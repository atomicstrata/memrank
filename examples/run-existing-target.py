"""Evaluate an EXISTING catalog target from a script -- no CLI, nothing saved.

Run from the repo root:

    python examples/run-existing-target.py

The target ref resolves exactly as `memrank submit` resolves it. `word-overlap` is a
built-in control arm, so this runs offline; a real engine ref ("mem0",
"hindsight:matched", or your own manifest on targets.path) works the same way BUT its
engine must already be reachable -- `memrank.run` provisions nothing. Provisioning,
run records, heartbeats and sync are what the CLI's `submit` adds on top.
