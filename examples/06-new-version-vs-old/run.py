"""Did the change help? Two versions of your own system, read side by side.

    uv run python examples/06-new-version-vs-old/run.py

Read three things. The GAP is the difference in means. The FLIPS are the
tasks whose value changed, and which way -- a version that fixes three and
breaks two has a gap near zero and is not the same system. The CAUTION
appears when there is too little here to characterise either.
