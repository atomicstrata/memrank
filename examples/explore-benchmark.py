"""Load ONE benchmark and look at it -- no runs, no targets, nothing written.

Run from the repo root:

    python examples/explore-benchmark.py

Uses `demo` so it runs offline and instantly. For the real thing, swap the ref for
e.g. "beam:100k-smoke" or "locomo:smoke" -- the first `load()`/`raw()` then downloads
the dataset into ~/.memrank/datasets (or $MEMRANK_CACHE_DIR) and is cached afterwards.
