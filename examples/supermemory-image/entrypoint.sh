# Launch supermemory-server. The server reads its LLM key from ~/.supermemory/env, but a container
# receives secrets as environment variables -- so mirror whichever provider key is present into that
# file before booting. Extraction fails (documents never reach status=done) without a working key,
# so require one rather than degrade.

# The server refuses to boot without SOME provider key and accepts any of four. It does not
# matter which, and on memrank's path it is never called: ingest posts pre-chunked content to
# /v4/memories, which skips the extractor, and the embedder is local. Verified by booting with an
# invalid key -- ingest and retrieve returned the correct document. So the key this asks for is a
# property of the image, not a credential the `supermemory` target spends.
#
# So this writes whichever key is present rather than demanding OpenAI's. Demanding one name made
# supermemory the only target a sweep needed a second provider account to run.
