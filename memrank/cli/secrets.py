"""`memrank secrets` -- the credentials wallet, in its two scopes.

Store the API keys you have once (:mod:`memrank.secrets.wallet`), or in an org's vault through the
API. What a given target *requires* is answered by `targets show <ref>`, which prints ✔/✘ per
required secret: the target owns that fact, so the catalog is where it is read. The
`memrank preflight` command that used to answer it here is retired -- a run refuses loudly with
the same information at the moment it matters, which cannot go stale between the check and the
run (localdocs/interface-model.md section 6).
