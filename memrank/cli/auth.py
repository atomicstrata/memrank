"""``memrank auth login`` / ``logout`` / ``status``.

A thin shell around :mod:`memrank.accounts.login_flow`. Identity is one noun-space rather
than three flat verbs, and ``status`` -- not a bare ``whoami`` -- is the name that can grow to
own credential validity, which is the plane's own business to diagnose.

Its own module rather than folded into ``runner.py``, which is already past the project's
400-line ceiling; ``secrets_cli`` and ``targets_cli`` set the same precedent.
