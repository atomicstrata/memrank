"""``memrank config`` -- the standing defaults, and where each one comes from.

``ls`` shows resolved values *with their source*, because the failure this plane produces is
never "the setting is missing" -- it is "the setting is not the one I set". A file value silently
overridden by an inherited environment variable is invisible until it costs a run.
