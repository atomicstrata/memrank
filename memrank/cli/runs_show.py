"""``memrank runs show`` -- one run in full, from whichever stores know it.

Split out of :mod:`memrank.cli.runs` because the listing and the detail view answer different
questions and neither needs the other's helpers: ``ls`` merges two stores into rows, ``show``
prints one run's state and results. The shared vocabulary lives with what owns it --
:mod:`memrank.runs.status` names the states, :mod:`memrank.runs.registry` groups the cells -- so
this module and the listing cannot drift into two spellings of one condition.
