"""`memrank watch` / `kill` -- the lifecycle verbs of the detached-by-default model.

Every submission returns immediately with run ids; blocking is a VERB, not a flag (the
interface model's rejected shapes: `--wait`, `--detach`). `watch <id...>` attaches until the
runs end -- late, again, or from CI -- polling a whole sweep TOGETHER rather than serialising
it. A local run is watched through its heartbeat (:mod:`memrank.runs.status`); a cloud run
through the platform API, inheriting `--wait`'s old promise: on success its artifacts come
down and it becomes indistinguishable from a local run.

`kill <id>` ends a local background run: one process executes a whole sweep, so the signal
ends every sibling, and the record must say so for each of them.
