"""``memrank runs`` -- the central entity, in both its tenses.

A run is one thing across its whole life: born at submission, live while executing, a durable
record when finished. "Live" is a status, not a different noun, so one listing shows both and
the state column tells them apart.

**A row is a run, and a run is one target.** The predecessor (``list-runs``) listed cells under
a shared sweep id, so a two-target sweep printed one run id twice -- an id that names two rows is
not a handle, and every verb the model adds later (``show``, ``watch``, ``kill``) takes an id as
its handle. Submission now closes the same defect from the other side: a comma sweep mints one
run per target (locally and in the cloud alike), so an id names exactly one target's row.

Two local stores answer, each for what it actually knows:

* :mod:`memrank.runs.status` -- the heartbeat, authoritative from the moment a run is born
  (targets, eval, state, timestamps, where it executes).
* :mod:`memrank.runs.registry` -- the recorded cells, authoritative once results exist
  (composite, config hash, artifact path).

A run folder with results but no heartbeat predates the heartbeat; its state reads ``unknown``
rather than being inferred from the presence of files. Guessing a terminal state is exactly the
lie the interface must not tell.

The listing merges the local stores with the org's universe over the platform API; ``show``
lives in :mod:`memrank.cli.runs_show`, which answers about one run rather than many.
