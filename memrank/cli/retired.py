"""Every command name and flag the CLI used to answer to, and what replaced each.

The surface is migrating to the interface model (localdocs/interface-model.md), and the cutover is
deliberately hard: an old name does not keep working, and it does not fail silently either --
it says what to type instead. A script that breaks breaks loudly, once, with the fix in the
message.

Tables rather than a stub beside each rename, so the rule is enumerated and testable: nothing
can be retired without a pointer, because the tests walk these dicts. Later retirements add a
row here, not another mechanism.
