"""Check a running translator against the adapter contract (``docs/adapter-contract.md``).

This exists because memrank ships as an isolated ``uv tool`` install, so somebody writing a
translator cannot run memrank's own pytest suite against it. Without this, their first signal that
the contract is violated would be a benchmark number -- and the failures that matter most here are
the ones that produce a plausible number rather than an error: state leaking between isolation
units, or an empty result standing in for a failure.

Deliberately narrow. It asserts the published contract and nothing else -- not whether the machine
is healthy, not whether credentials exist, not whether the engine is any good.
``localdocs/interface-model.md`` rejects a general ``doctor`` command for good reasons, and those reasons
still apply: every check here is about a third party's implementation of a spec, which nothing else
in the tool examines.
