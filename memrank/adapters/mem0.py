"""Mem0 OSS adapter.

Two execution modes (chosen at runtime, no fallback chains):

1. ``sdk`` -- uses the ``mem0`` Python SDK (``mem0ai`` on PyPI). Requires
   ``pip install memrank[mem0]`` and any LLM/vector-store env vars Mem0
   itself reads.
2. ``http`` -- talks to a local Mem0 OSS server over HTTP at
   ``MEM0_HTTP_URL`` (default ``http://localhost:8888``).

Selection: pass ``mode="sdk"`` or ``mode="http"`` to the constructor. When
omitted, the adapter defaults to ``http`` (the validated path with consistent
search semantics); ``sdk`` is opt-in and not auto-selected, so behavior never
silently changes based on whether ``mem0ai`` happens to be installed.
