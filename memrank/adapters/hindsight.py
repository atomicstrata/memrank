"""Hindsight HTTP adapter.

Talks to a self-hosted Hindsight API (``hindsight-api``) over HTTP. Each
isolation unit gets its own bank, optionally reset on prepare so prior unit
state cannot leak in.

Targets the current Hindsight API (``ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight``, port
8888): banks are created idempotently via ``PUT /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}``,
memories are retained under ``.../{bank_id}/memories`` and recalled under
``.../{bank_id}/memories/recall``.
