"""One rendering of a Document into the text an engine ingests.

Every text-ingesting adapter used to render documents its own way, and none of them
carried WHEN the conversation happened. Engines therefore stamped memories with
ingestion time: a 2023 LoCoMo conversation was stored as "August 2026", and 321 of
1540 temporal queries were unanswerable by construction
(docs/2026-08-04-audit-vendor-spec-vs-our-configuration.md, F15).

Only hindsight has a native ingest-timestamp field. The AtomicMemory wire contract has
none (am-wire IngestRequest is user_id/conversation/source_site/source_url/session_id),
and supermemory's documented path does not either -- so **the text is the only channel
every engine has**. That makes this the chokepoint per CLAUDE.md: one renderer, used by
every adapter, rather than the date being remembered in three places and forgotten in a
fourth. Adapters with a native field still send it; the two carry different weight, since
the native field drives temporal filtering while the text drives extraction.

This is also what the vendors ask for. Hindsight's ingest guidance is that a conversation
should convey "who said what, and when"; supermemory's own benchmark harness prepends the
session date to the content it stores.

    2023"; passing that through is honest, whereas choosing a format because it resembles
    a gold answer ("7 May 2023") would be tuning to the scorer. The ISO ``timestamp`` stays
    the machine field, sent natively by adapters whose engine accepts one.

    Gated on ``messages`` because ``context`` means different things for different
    benchmarks: for a conversation it is "who, and when", but for a relation-graph document
    it is a description that adapters already pass separately (supermemory sends it as
    ``entity_context`` metadata). Prepending it there would change what a non-conversational
    benchmark stores, for a fix that has nothing to do with it.
