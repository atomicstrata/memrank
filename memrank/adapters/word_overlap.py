"""In-process word-overlap retrieval -- the "dumb memory" floor.

Ranks documents by how many words they share with the question. Gives the reader a floor: a real
engine must beat dumb keyword matching to be interesting. Runs in-process (labeled as such);
excluded from HTTP latency ranking.

Named for the mechanism at the level the mechanism lives. It was `baseline` until 2026-08-19 -- a
ROLE every control arm occupies, carrying no information -- and `lexical` until 2026-08-20, which
was BEIR's FAMILY label where an instance-level name existed. Not `bm25`, which would be false: the
score below is an unweighted set intersection, no IDF, no term frequency, no length normalisation.
