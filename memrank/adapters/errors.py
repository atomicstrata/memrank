"""When an engine refuses a request, say what it said.

Every HTTP adapter guarded its calls with a bare ``response.raise_for_status()``. httpx's
``HTTPStatusError`` carries the status line and the URL and **not the body** -- which is the only
place an engine explains itself. That exception then reached ``runner._exit_with``'s last branch
and printed::

    error: internal error: HTTPStatusError: Client error '400 Bad Request' for url
    'http://localhost:17350/v1/memories/ingest'
    note: this is a bug in memrank; re-run with MEMRANK_DEBUG=1 for a traceback

Both halves are wrong. The reason was discarded at the one moment it existed, and an engine
rejecting our payload was reported as a defect in the harness -- sending the reader to read memrank's
source rather than the engine's answer. On 2026-08-13 that cost a BEAM run three hours of completed
ingest and left nothing to diagnose it with. :class:`memrank.runner.RateLimitExhausted` records the
identical lesson one status code over: a 429 that printed "this is a bug in memrank" "sends the
reader hunting the wrong thing entirely".

``adapters/native.py`` already got this right and is the model: it never calls
``raise_for_status``, checks the status by hand, and puts the translator's own error text in the
message. This module generalises that to the four adapters that talk HTTP to a vendor engine.

WHY THE BODY IS REDACTED AND CAPPED. An engine's error body is not ours and can echo anything it
was sent -- retrieved memory content, or a request header including the bearer token it just
rejected. ``memrank.errors`` states the standing policy that error paths must not leak what
``submit`` decrypted, which is why there is no locals-rendering traceback mode; the same rule
applies to a body we did not write.
