"""The mandatory baseline arms -- the hypothesis test, run on every row.

``docs/PRD_Memrank_v2.md`` requires three controls beside every engine: (a) no-memory,
(b) a **token-matched** in-context baseline at the same retrieval budget, and (c) full-context where
the knowledge base fits. Together they answer the project's central hypothesis: external memory
"make[s] the decisive difference when the knowledge base is too large to fit in the model's context
window -- and [is] worth [its] tokens against a naive baseline that just reads what it can."

None of these retrieve in any meaningful sense, which is the point. They are deliberately *not*
memory systems: ``no-context`` supplies nothing, and the in-context arms supply the corpus unranked, so
whatever the engine under test wins by is attributable to retrieval rather than to context size.
