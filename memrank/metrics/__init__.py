"""Scoring arithmetic -- everything that turns a run into a number without asking a model.

`headline` owns the single rule for which number represents a cell, so the CLI, the API and the
leaderboard can never disagree about what a run scored. The rest are the measurements it chooses
between: `scoring` decides whether retrieval actually surfaced the gold evidence (by content, not
by engine-assigned id, and with no "non-empty means hit" fallback), `evidence_recall` and
`retrieval` implement the benchmarks' own published judge-free metrics, and `ordering` scores an
aligned sequence against a reference. `cost` prices a query's context in tokens.

Everything here is pure and deterministic. Judgement -- anything that needs a model's opinion --
lives in :mod:`memrank.judging` instead.
