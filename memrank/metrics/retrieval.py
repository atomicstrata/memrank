"""LongMemEval's two published retrieval metrics, judge-free.

`recall_all@k` and `ndcg_any@k` (`src/retrieval/eval_utils.py`) are the only LongMemEval numbers
that measure the memory system rather than the reader or the judge. They are immune to every
divergence the ADR accepts -- judge model, reading strategy, answer length -- which makes them the
one place a memrank LongMemEval figure can be compared to a published one without an argument
about instruments.

**`recall_all@k` is a per-question 0/1 indicator: 1 only when EVERY gold document is inside the
top k.** It is not fractional recall. Reporting fractional recall under this name inflates the
number substantially, and doing so is the single easiest way to publish a wrong LongMemEval
figure -- which is why the distinction is asserted by a test rather than only described here.

Two exclusions, both RETRIEVAL-ONLY: the 30 abstention items (no ground-truth location exists)
and the 51 questions whose evidence is assistant-side (the paper indexes user-side utterances
only). The author confirmed in issue #16 that these must not reach the QA denominator, which
stays 500; several publications made exactly that error. The loader marks both via
``retrieval_scoreable``.

Presence is decided by DETERMINISTIC CONTENT MATCHING, reusing `memrank.metrics.evidence_recall`'s
matcher (containment, then 8-gram shingle Jaccard) so the two benchmarks share one definition of
"this retrieved text is that session", versioned by ``EVIDENCE_MATCHER_VERSION``. Only the
matcher is shared; the text it runs against differs, see ``_session_texts``.

An id join is not available and never will be: engines return their own opaque ids -- which is
what made the original gold-id proxy score a constant 0.0 -- and the positional handles the
harness mints are deliberately withheld from engines, because the dataset's real ids leak the
answer location.

Declared limitation, inherited: an engine that stores paraphrases legitimately misses a content
match. These are retrieval diagnostics reported beside the judged number, never folded into it.
