"""The one rule that decides a cell's headline score.

Every surface that shows "the score" reads it from here: ``memrank runs ls``, ``runs show``, the
runs API (and therefore the web GUI), the runner's end-of-run line, the leaderboard and
``compare``. They disagreed before. Three of them carried their own copy of the legacy
rankability default and one of those copies was wrong, so a legacy BEAM record ranked in the GUI
while every other surface withheld it. Worse, none of them promoted the JUDGED score: a judged
BEAM run -- the only kind of BEAM run that measures anything -- displayed "—" everywhere while its
real number sat unread in ``judged_metrics``.

The rule, in precedence order:

1. **Judged**, when the run was judged and covered any questions at all. This is the benchmarks'
   own protocol (LoCoMo and LongMemEval grade a generated answer; BEAM grades rubric nuggets),
   so when it exists it is not one score among several -- it is the score. Rankable only at
   ``MIN_RANKABLE_COVERAGE`` or better, because a number computed over a third of the questions
   is a real measurement of an unstated subset, publishable but not comparable.
2. **The self-contained composite**, when the benchmark declares one and it is rankable. Today
   that means the internal ``demo`` fixture and ``relation_graph``'s structural score; the three
   external benchmarks no longer report a composite at all.
3. **Withheld.** No number is the honest answer, and it is a different statement from zero.

Deliberately artifact-driven: nothing here branches on a benchmark's name. An old artifact
carries the flags it was written with and is projected by what it says, so re-reading history
never depends on today's registry.
