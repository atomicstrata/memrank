"""The evaluations memrank ships, as classes -- `from memrank.evaluations import SQuAD`.

`memrank.evaluation("squad")` needs the string first, and a string is not navigable: nothing in
an editor follows it, nothing states what a tier or a slice may be, and nothing tells a reader
what else is out there. Each class here is a subclass of `memrank.Evaluation` whose constructor
takes the keywords its benchmark takes, typed, and loads it -- so `SQuAD()` beside
`TFIDF()` reads as two nouns of one shape, and "go to definition" on either lands on a
class whose docstring says what it is.

The construction goes through `memrank.evaluation(...)` underneath, so there is one conversion
and not two, and an instance carries exactly the fields the string form produces.

================  ==================================================================
name              what it needs
================  ==================================================================
SQuAD()           nothing -- 32 bundled passages, 64 questions
Demo()            nothing -- a bundled synthetic scenario
RelationGraph()   nothing -- in-repo fixtures
LoCoMo()          a one-time download, or LOCOMO_DATA_PATH; judging for any quality
LongMemEval()     a one-time download, or LONGMEMEVAL_DATA_PATH; judging likewise
BEAM()            a one-time download, or BEAM_DATA_PATH; judging likewise
================  ==================================================================

Each benchmark class is imported INSIDE its constructor. `import memrank` reaches this module,
and a dataset loader's module graph is not something a caller who asked for `SQuAD()` should pay
for. `memrank.catalog()` prints this table at runtime.
