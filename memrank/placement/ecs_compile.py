"""Compile a target's declared Compose graph into ECS container definitions.

A translation, not a second description. Everything here has a published meaning on both sides --
Compose's service key becomes a container name, its `healthcheck` becomes `healthCheck`, its
`depends_on` condition becomes a `dependsOn` condition -- so the cloud runs the graph the author
wrote rather than one the renderer inferred from a `depends` list. That inference is what let the
two placements drift: cloud pulled a mirrored embedder image at an ambient tag while local pulled
the vendor's, under one target name, with no receipt field recording which.

Two things do NOT translate, and are handled rather than ignored:

* **Topology.** Compose gives each service its own DNS name; under `awsvpc` every container in a
  task shares one network namespace, so a neighbour is reached on `localhost`. This is the only
  axis on which a rendered cloud environment may legitimately differ from the local one.
* **Anything ECS cannot express faithfully** -- mounted volumes, `build`, published host ports,
  services that disagree about their platform. Those are REFUSED by name. A renderer that quietly
  drops what it does not understand produces a task definition that launches and measures
  something other than what was declared.

#: Compose keys with no faithful ECS equivalent under Fargate. Each is refused by name.
#:
#: `volumes` and `build` are the substantive ones -- a bind mount has no meaning in a task that

#: naming a container the author never wrote and no file it appears in. They are checked HERE

    container is translated without anyone remembering to extend a table -- which is precisely how
    the retired ``_topology_environment`` went stale, keyed as it was on a hardcoded ``depends``
    list rather than on the services that actually exist.

    Only two positions count as a host: the whole value (optionally with a port), and the authority
    of a URL. A match anywhere else is left alone. Rewriting every occurrence turned ``MODE: engine``
    into ``MODE: localhost`` -- an engine whose configuration happened to contain a word matching a
    service name would have been silently misconfigured, with no error and nothing to fail.

    A bare whole-value match is only rewritten for a NEIGHBOUR. A service naming itself is far more
    likely to be saying what it is than where to reach itself, and the two cannot be told apart from
    the value. The residual ambiguity is real and deliberate: a neighbour's name as a whole value is
    treated as a host whatever the variable means, because a compiler with no schema cannot know
    better -- and the alternative, requiring a URL, would not rewrite ``POSTGRES_HOST: datastore``,
