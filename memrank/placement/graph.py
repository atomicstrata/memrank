"""A target's container graph, read from the Compose file its manifest names.

What a target runs is DECLARED, not assembled: the file lists every container, the images they run,
how they depend on one another and when each is healthy -- all of it in the Compose Specification's
own vocabulary, which both placements then read. Before this, the graph existed only as literals
inside the local renderer and, separately, inside an ECS task-definition template, so the two could
and did disagree about which model an engine was pointed at.

The one thing a graph must not state is what is being MEASURED. Component values -- the embedder,
the LLM -- come from the manifest and reach the containers by interpolation, so there is exactly one
place that says what a target is made of.

    that typed it twice is exactly how an engine came to be pointed at a model its sidecar was not
