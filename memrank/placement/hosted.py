"""When the hosted side could not be consulted, and whether that is worth saying.

Two paths reach for the org universe while serving a request that may be entirely local:
``runs ls`` merges the org's rows into this machine's own, and the hook after each finished run
pushes it to the org. Both come back empty-handed on a machine that was never set up for the
hosted side, and both used to say so -- which put a line about organizations and ``auth login``
under every local evaluation, at the moment the person was trying to read a score.

The distinction that decides it is **absent** versus **broken**:

* *Absent* -- not signed in, or no ``defaults.org`` -- is not a fault. Nothing hosted is in play,
  the question asked was local, and the answer given was local. There is nothing to report.
* *Broken* -- a credential store that refused, a 403, an unreachable API -- is a fault worth
  reporting, because this machine **is** configured for the hosted side and did not get what it
  is configured to get.

An explicitly hosted ask (``runs ls --org``, ``runs sync``) overrides the distinction: there,
absence is the whole answer and staying quiet would leave the person with nothing.

Decided here rather than at each call site so the paths cannot drift apart, and so a third one
inherits the rule instead of re-deriving it.
