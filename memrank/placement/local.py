"""Provision a target as a disposable compose project on this machine.

Renders the compose from the manifest rather than reusing the engine repo's own file. That file
builds from source and bind-mounts the developer's working tree, which is right for a dev loop and
wrong for a reproducible run: it would evaluate uncommitted engine code under a target name that
means something else. ``--on local`` therefore runs the *published* artifact, the same one the cloud
runs, so a local row and a cloud row can be compared on more than a name.

Host ports are never chosen. Publishing target-only (``127.0.0.1::8000``) makes the daemon bind port
0, which is atomic, and the assigned port is read back with ``docker compose port``. Picking a port --
fixed or base-offset -- is the documented anti-pattern and is racy between the check and the bind;
``scripts/local-eval.sh`` did exactly that and every disposable stack collided. Because each run gets
its own project name and its own kernel-assigned ports, K runs coexist with no coordination.
