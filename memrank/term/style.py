"""Semantic terminal styling and the two output streams -- the one chokepoint the CLI emits through.

Color is presentation only: every escape code goes through ``typer.style``/``typer.echo``,
so Click strips it when the stream is not a TTY, and the ``NO_COLOR`` convention
(https://no-color.org) is honored here, at the chokepoint. Nothing styled here may be
stored (heartbeats, receipts, ``--json``) -- style at the echo site, never in the data.
Fragments destined for width-padded table cells must be padded before styling;
``state()`` does this itself via its ``width`` argument.

**Which stream, and why it is decided here.** stdout carries the command's ANSWER -- run ids,
``--json``, log content, the table a listing was asked for. Everything else -- progress,
confirmations, hints, warnings, errors -- is stderr, so that piping a command yields its answer
and nothing else. Two emitters, :func:`out` and :func:`say`, so the choice is made once per line
by naming what the line IS, and no caller reaches for ``typer.echo`` and picks a stream by
accident. ``tests/term/test_output_streams.py`` enumerates the package to keep it that way.
