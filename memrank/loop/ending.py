"""Every way ``memrank run`` can end, as the one :class:`~memrank.outcome.Outcome` it shows.

The exception that ended a run says what went wrong; the run's trace (:mod:`memrank.loop.trace`)
says how far it got. Together they decide the ending: done, a step for the reader (their agent,
their key, their network, Ctrl-C), or broken -- which is kept for failures inside memrank
itself, so that nothing another system did is ever reported as a bug in memrank.
