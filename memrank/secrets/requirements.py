"""Per-engine launch requirements -- the credentials needed to *instantiate* a memory engine.

memrank benchmarks an engine over HTTP; whether that engine runs in a local docker container or in
the cloud, launching it needs credentials. Those requirements follow from the **provider** in use,
not the specific model: openai -> ``OPENAI_API_KEY``, anthropic -> ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``,
voyage -> ``VOYAGE_API_KEY``; local providers (TEI / in-process ONNX / ollama) need no key. This
module declares, per engine, the canonical launch providers + any fixed secrets, and derives the set
of required secret env-vars. It is deliberately launch-mode-agnostic -- it answers "what does this
experiment need to be launchable?", which :mod:`memrank.config` preflights before a run.
