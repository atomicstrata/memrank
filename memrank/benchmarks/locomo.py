"""LoCoMo benchmark (snap-research/locomo).

10 multi-session conversations x ~199 QA pairs each = 1986 questions in
4 scored categories -- in the DATA's integer order: 1=multi-hop (282),
2=temporal (321), 3=open-domain (96), 4=single-hop (841). Adversarial
questions (category 5, 446) are excluded: 444 of them ship no `answer`
field, so the official scorer itself cannot run on them.

LoCoMo's published protocol scores the GENERATED answer against the reference --
token-level F1, or a binary LLM-judge verdict. This module therefore ships no
self-contained quality score: ``score()`` reports the question counts and nothing
else, and quality comes from ``--judge``.

Two retrieval-only proxies were tried here before and both were withdrawn. Recall
of gold doc ids failed because engines return their own opaque ids and do not echo
``doc_id`` back, so it scored a constant 0.0 for every engine. Its replacement asked
whether the reference answer appeared as a verbatim SPAN of a retrieved document,
which LoCoMo does not define and which its derived answers ("3 times", "2022")
cannot satisfy at any retrieval quality. A proxy that measures storage literalness
is worse than no number, because it ranks.

``gold_answers`` and ``evidence_doc_ids`` are still loaded: the first is what the
judge grades against, the second is LoCoMo's own evidence annotation.

        ("When did Caroline go to the support group?"), so attribution is part of the
        answer rather than presentation. Three fields, each load-bearing:

        ``role`` is a wire-valid API role -- engines expect OpenAI-shaped messages, and
        ``"Caroline"`` is not a role. Speaker A maps to ``user``, B to ``assistant``.

        ``content`` carries the speaker name inline because adapters forward only role

        before it reaches the engine. This is also what Hindsight's ingest guidance asks

        ``speaker`` is kept structured so an adapter can render better than the prefix.

        Same gap LongMemEval had: the metric was computed per conversation and never reduced, so
        the only official LoCoMo metric no other harness computes was also one memrank could not
        read. Weighted by each unit's `n_queries_with_evidence`, so a 199-question conversation
        outweighs a 96-question one and a unit with no evidence contributes nothing.
