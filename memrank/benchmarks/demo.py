"""Hand-crafted demo benchmark.

A small, synthetic, multi-session conversation with durable facts, distractors,
and a negative/abstention query -- authored so engines genuinely differ and a
lazy "non-empty retrieval" cannot win. Scored by the evidence-based scorer.

#: The bundled scenario, resolved beside this module inside the package.
#:
#: It used to be found by walking two directories up to `examples/data/`, a path that exists
#: only in a checkout: from a `pip install memrank` the demo failed on a missing file, and the
#: demo is the one benchmark that needs no engine, no credential and no download. The file now
#: ships as package data (`[tool.setuptools.package-data]`), so the package carries its own
#: scenario wherever it is installed.
#:
#: `Path(__file__).parent` rather than `importlib.resources.files()` for the same reason
#: `memrank/targets/catalog.py` resolves `builtin/` this way: `files()` returns a `Traversable`,
#: whose only importable name across our 3.10 floor and 3.12 is `importlib.abc.Traversable`,
#: which 3.12 deprecates and 3.14 removes. Both forms ask the package where it is; this one
#: stays a `Path`, which is also what a `DEMO_DATA_PATH` override is. ATO-2059.
