"""LongMemEval benchmark (xiaowu0162/longmemeval-cleaned).

~500 questions across 6 question types, each with its own haystack of
conversation sessions. Each item is its own isolation unit (one bank per
question).

LongMemEval's published metric is QA accuracy: generate an answer from the
retrieved context, then grade it with an LLM judge. The paper rejects string
matching outright -- "as the correct answers can take flexible forms, an exact
matching strategy can result in inaccurate evaluations" -- and instructs its judge
to weigh semantic and temporal consistency instead. So this module ships no
self-contained quality score; ``score()`` reports counts, and quality comes from
``--judge``.

Two proxies were tried here and both were withdrawn. Gold-session-id recall scored
a constant 0.0 because engines return their own opaque ids. Its replacement asked
whether the reference answer appeared as a verbatim SPAN of retrieved text -- the
very strategy the paper rejects, and one that scored every abstention item 0 for
every engine by construction, since an abstention has no answer text to find.

``gold_answers`` and the ``has_answer`` session annotations are still loaded: the
first is what the judge grades against, the second is the dataset's own evidence
labelling.

**Ingest is sequential, in array order, matching the official harness.** The paper's task
definition is that a system "parse the dynamic interactions online for memorization, and answer
the question after all the interaction sessions", and the runner ingests one document at a time
in list order before querying. That list is the file's own `haystack_sessions` order, which is
sorted by DATE but not by time of day: on 211 of 500 instances the times run backwards within a
day. This is deliberately NOT re-sorted -- `run_generation.py` walks the sessions in the same
array order and re-sorts only the RETRIEVED chunks at read time (line 225), so array order is
the faithful ingest and chronological order would be the divergence.

**Dates are rendered into the text, and ordering is not enforced.** The official harness renders
``Session Date: {date}`` above every session and then sorts retrieved items by timestamp
(``run_generation.py:225``). It can sort because it *is* the retriever. memrank cannot: real
engines return their own documents -- ``mem0.py:566`` builds ``Document(id, content, user_id,
metadata)``, and no adapter carries our ``Document.timestamp`` back out -- so only the control
arms (which return our own objects, already in ingest order) could be sorted, and sorting just
those would make context order engine-dependent. That is the shape of defect the opaque-handle
work exists to remove, so it is not reintroduced here. The date therefore travels in ``content``,
which every engine preserves or paraphrases honestly, and the reader is left to order by it.
Recorded as a declared divergence rather than half-solved.

        Four values: the documents, the `has_answer` gold handles, handle->session-id, and its

        and the signature said three for as long as it went unmentioned.

        Documents are keyed by OPAQUE POSITIONAL HANDLES, never by the dataset's own session
        ids. LongMemEval prefixes every evidence session id with `answer` and its official
        retrieval scorer keys on that prefix (run_retrieval.py:272), so the id is a noise-free
        oracle: ranking on it alone scores recall_all@10 = 1.000, above the paper's best
        retriever. Passing it to an engine -- as `Document.id`, which adapters forward as metadata
        per docs/system-contract.md:71, or inside `context`, which two adapters map to
        semantically indexed fields -- hands over the answer location.

        The real ids stay harness-side in the returned map, which `load()` puts on the unit's
        metadata so retrieval scoring can still resolve `answer_session_ids`.
