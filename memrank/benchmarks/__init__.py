    measures latency and cost and nothing else. False where the benchmark has a valid metric of
    its own (``demo``'s substring recall over verbatim spans, ``relation_graph``'s graph score),
    and judging adds a second measurement rather than the only one.

    The single definition of "does this eval need judging". The CLI derives the default from it,
