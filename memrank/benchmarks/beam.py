"""BEAM benchmark (Mohammadta/BEAM).

100 conversations of 100K-10M tokens, 2000 probing questions across 10
memory ability categories. Memrank v0.1 supports the 100K, 500K, and 1M
tiers; 10M is reserved for v0.2 (memory + bandwidth requirements).

BEAM scores against a ``rubric`` of atomic nuggets -- one judge call each, scored
{0, 0.5, 1} and averaged within the question. ``judge_shape()`` returns that grader,
so ``--judge`` measures BEAM the way BEAM specifies. All ten abilities are covered:
nine by rubric averaging, and ``event_ordering`` by rank correlation over its ordered
rubric, because averaging that one would score a reversed answer identically to a
correct one.

Without ``--judge`` this module ships NO quality number. It used to compute a
retrieval-recall proxy while declaring it structurally invalid (the rubric is prose, not
verbatim spans) and withholding it from rankings -- but a number that is computed and
displayed per-ability gets quoted whatever the flag beside it says, and it distorted the
data it touched: abstention probes had to be dropped from its denominator entirely. So
BEAM quality requires ``--judge``, and ``score()`` reports only counts without one.

Engines are handed role+content ONLY -- no rendered time anchors, no machine ``timestamp``,
no ``query_timestamp`` -- and the reader's context is uncapped (``context_policy``). That is
what every published BEAM harness does, including BEAM's own baselines, and it is what makes
a memrank BEAM number a BEAM number rather than a memrank variant of one. The dataset's
``time_anchor`` field exists and is deliberately not forwarded: only 16 of 90 sessions at
100k restate their date in-band, so forwarding it would hand our engines temporal
information no other harness's systems had.

        """Report what was asked and what came back; BEAM's verdict is the rubric judge's.

        No composite. The substring proxy that used to live here asked whether an ability's gold
        answer appeared verbatim in retrieved text, which BEAM's prose ``ideal_response`` cannot
        satisfy -- the module has always declared it structurally invalid -- and it forced its own
        distortions: abstention probes had to be excluded from the denominator entirely, because
        a negative carrying no ``forbidden_spans`` scores an unconditional hit. Withholding the
        number was never enough while it was still computed and still shown per-ability.

        ``judge_shape()`` is where BEAM is actually scored: one call per rubric nugget on
        {0, 0.5, 1}, averaged within the question.
