    seventy documents paid it or one did. Derived rather than measured separately, so it can never
    disagree with the summary it comes from.

    THIS USED TO CALL ITSELF WALL-CLOCK AND IS NOT. ``count * mean_ms`` sums every document's
    latency, so under ``--workers N`` it overstates elapsed time by roughly N: a run that took
    11m 30s reported 50m 49s, and `runs show --full` printed it as "ingest total". The field is now
    named for what it measures. Elapsed time comes from the run's own timestamps --
    ``status.json``'s ``started_at``/``synced_at``, which is what `scripts/internal/inspect-run.py timing`
    prints beside this so the two can never be confused again.

    ``documents_per_second`` inherits the same meaning: per-worker throughput, not the run's. It is
    a property of the ENGINE (how fast one document is absorbed) rather than of the harness (how
    many were absorbed at once), which is the useful reading for comparing engines.

    ``None`` rather than zero for an empty ingest -- the read-only controls (`no-context`, `fixed-context`) ingest
    nothing, and 0 docs/sec would read as an engine that is infinitely slow rather than one that
    was never asked.
