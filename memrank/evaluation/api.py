"""``memrank.run`` -- evaluate a memory engine from a Python script, and nothing else.

The supported library entry point: resolve the engine and the evaluation the way the CLI
does, run the cell, return a typed :class:`EvalResult`. No run directory, no
``status.json``, no sync, no cloud -- the only disk touched is the dataset/tokenizer/judge
caches, and the only network egress is the engine under test (plus Anthropic when judged).

The two parameters were once ``target`` and ``eval`` -- the command line's own nouns, on a
Python function. Both are still accepted as keywords and warn; see
:data:`DEPRECATED_PARAMETERS`, which is what ``tests/repo/test_python_vocabulary.py``
enumerates so a third spelling cannot appear without a deliberate edit.

        engine: A catalog name (``"mem0"``, ``"hindsight:matched"``, ``"word-overlap"``)
            or a ready :class:`MemoryAdapter` instance. A name is resolved exactly as
            ``memrank submit`` resolves it; a container-backed engine must already be
            reachable -- this function provisions nothing.
        evaluation: A catalog name (``"demo"``, ``"locomo:smoke"``, ``"beam:100k-smoke"``)
            or a :class:`Benchmark` instance. ``load()`` may download the dataset into the
            cache on first use.
        judge: ``None`` asks the benchmark (`judge_required`) -- the evals whose
            protocol IS the judge get one by default; ``True``/``False`` force it; a
            :class:`JudgeConfig` is used as given. Judging calls Anthropic and keeps a
            local verdict cache (``JudgeConfig(cache=False)`` opts out).
        fail_fast: Stop at the first unit that raises. The default attempts every unit and
            records what happened to each on ``result.unit_outcomes``, with the counts under
            ``units_total``/``units_failed``.
        observer: Where progress narration goes. ``None`` is silent -- pass an
            :class:`EvalObserver` subclass to hear about units, items and warnings.
        checkpoint_path: ``None`` writes no checkpoint. Give a path to make a judged
            run resumable (``memrank ops rejudge``) at the cost of one file.
        target: Deprecated spelling of ``engine``. Accepted, warns, removed at step 22.
        eval: Deprecated spelling of ``evaluation``. Accepted, warns, removed at step 22.

    Defaults mirror ``memrank submit``'s (k=10, repeats=3, seed=42, token_budget=5000,
    priced at gpt-4o-mini), so a script and a sweep of the same cell agree.

    Note: ``seed`` seeds the process-global ``random`` module, and the tokenizer
    downloads (~4 MB, cached) on first cost accounting -- both inherited from the
    measurement loop and documented rather than hidden.
