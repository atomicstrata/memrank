"""The eval library: run one (adapter x benchmark) cell and hand back its result.

What belongs here: the measurement loop (`cell`), its aggregation into the artifact
dict (`aggregate`), the judge stage (`judge_stage`), the provenance receipt
(`receipt`), and the observer contract the loop narrates through (`observer`).

What does not: terminals, run directories, heartbeats, placement, cloud, Typer.
Nothing under `memrank.evaluation` may import `memrank.cli`, `memrank.placement`,
`memrank.accounts`, or `memrank.runs.registry` -- the run lifecycle wires those
concerns in from outside, through an `EvalObserver`. (`runs.status` and `term.style`
are a TEMPORARY exception carried by `observer._GlobalsObserver`, the pre-split
default; it leaves with the CLI split.)
