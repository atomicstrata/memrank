"""The typed result of one evaluated cell -- and the artifact schema's single owner.

``EvalResult.to_dict()`` emits the per-cell artifact dict byte-for-byte as the pre-split
``_aggregate_cell`` built it (``aggregate.build_result`` constructs the instance, and the
dict form is consumed as-is by ten downstream modules: registry, record, leaderboard,
API projection, the uploader). Two rules keep that contract honest, both pinned by
``tests/orchestration/test_golden_run.py``:

- ``judged_metrics`` is ABSENT when no judge ran, never null -- absent means "no judge
  ran"; null would claim a judge ran and produced nothing.
- ``rollup`` and ``benchmark_config`` are spread LAST, so a benchmark-declared key
  shadows a closed one exactly as the two trailing ``**`` spreads always have. The spread
  position is unchanged and still pinned there -- what changed is that a key which WOULD
  shadow a closed field is now refused at assembly (:class:`ShadowedResultField`) instead of
  replacing it silently.

**THE KEYS ARE NAMED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE.** A result dict's identity keys --
``adapter`` and ``benchmark`` -- were read by literal subscript in nine modules, so every
one of them was a second place the artifact vocabulary was interpreted and a tenth edit
whenever it changes. The four accessors below are the only place those two strings appear,
and ``tests/repo/test_result_vocabulary.py`` enumerates every module to keep it that way.
Translating them into the OUTWARD vocabulary is a separate, single job, and
:func:`memrank.api.run_projection.identity_of` is the one place it happens.

Strict and tolerant are separate functions rather than one with a default, because which of
the two a caller wants is a real distinction here: a curator pairing battles must fail on a
row with no engine, while a listing built from artifacts on disk must render a half-written
cell rather than raise out of the whole listing. A single accessor with a default would make
every caller look tolerant and hide which ones actually are.
