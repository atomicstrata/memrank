    collector holds the same samples, but it is an implementation detail -- ``MemoryAdapter``
    publishes ``latency_metrics()`` and nothing else, so an adapter that satisfies the interface
    without using ``LatencyCollector`` is a legal adapter and must still be measurable.

    The timing comes back FROM ``_ingest_one`` rather than wrapping it, because a rate-limit pause
    is time the runner chose to wait, not time the engine took to answer. Wrapping the call put
    that pause inside the sample: a 30-second gate wait would have landed in ``ingest p95`` and
    made a throttled run look like a slow engine.

    would report a throttled account as a slow engine.

    The tempting version wraps this in backoff and moves on. It would be wrong, because a failed
    ingest is not necessarily a no-op: mem0's `add()` extracts, reconciles, then writes in a loop,
    so a failure in the third phase leaves the scope half-written and a retry re-extracts against a
    partially populated store. Whether that duplicates depends on a reconcile LLM noticing, which
    is not a foundation for a benchmark number.

    So the question is asked rather than assumed. `state_fingerprint` digests the scope before the
    attempt and again after the failure:

      - UNCHANGED -- the call wrote nothing, so retrying is exactly equivalent to never having
        failed. Retry.
      - CHANGED -- a partial write. Refuse, and say so: the store is no longer in a state anything
        can reason about.
      - UNAVAILABLE (`None`) -- the engine cannot be asked, so equivalence cannot be shown. Refuse.
        A benchmark that retries on hope is worse than one that stops.

    The pause is taken on ``gate`` rather than by sleeping here, because a rate limit is
    account-wide and this thread's silence does nothing about the other workers still saturating
    it. See ``memrank.rate_limit`` -- that distinction is why the first version of this retry
    recovered 35 limits and still lost the run.
