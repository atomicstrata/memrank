"""Where to send a reader who needs the documentation.

``docs/`` is a directory in the repository and is NOT in the wheel: ``pyproject.toml`` excludes it
from the packages that ship, so ``pip install memrank`` leaves no ``docs/`` anywhere on the
machine. A message that says "see docs/adapter-contract.md" therefore names a file the reader does
not have, at the moment they are already stuck -- which is the defect ATO-2125 exists to remove.

The answer is a URL rather than a path: it resolves from any working directory, on a laptop that
never cloned anything, and it is the same document the maintainers read. One function builds every
such link so the branch and the repository are stated once.
