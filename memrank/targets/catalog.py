"""Target discovery: where manifests live, and how a ref becomes a resolved Manifest.

Three sources, in increasing precedence: the manifests shipped inside the package, then every
directory on the ``targets.path`` setting, then the operator's own directory
(``${MEMRANK_CONFIG_DIR}/targets``, the same config home the secrets wallet uses). The resolved
canonical ref is what callers echo back, so a short ref never silently means something the operator
did not expect.

``targets.path`` is what lets a descriptor live beside the translator it launches, in a folder the
operator owns -- so the pair can be copied or shared as one thing. Its directories are peers, so a
name two of them both claim is refused rather than resolved. Each entry carries the directory it
came from, because a relative ``binding.root`` is resolved against it.
