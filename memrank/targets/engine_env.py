"""The env vars that configure an engine's components -- named in exactly one place.

Three surfaces must agree on these names: the engine process itself, the local compose renderer, and
the cloud taskdef renderer. Before this table that agreement was a coincidence. It held for mem0
only because mem0's server happens to read the same names the adapter convention assumes, and it
already failed elsewhere: hindsight reads ``HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL`` while the convention would
produce ``HINDSIGHT_LLM_MODEL``, and atomicmemory reads a bare ``EMBEDDING_MODEL``.

Per the `CLAUDE.md` chokepoint rule, the names live here and both renderers derive from them, rather
than each restating its own copy. What this function returns is the *only* part of an engine's
environment that must be byte-identical across placements; network topology (hostnames, ports,
service discovery) legitimately differs and is the placement's own business.

    """A target's ``engine_env:`` block, refused if it would contradict its own components.

    `manifest.py` validates the shape and rejects collisions with declared secrets, but it cannot
    see `ENGINE_ENV` -- importing this module there would be circular. So the adapter-specific half
    of the guard lives here, at the point both placements assemble the environment.

    The collision matters because the two halves disagree silently: a target declaring
    ``llm: {model: am-slm-next}`` and ``engine_env: {AM_HG_EXTRACTOR_MODEL: other}`` would put
    `other` on the wire while the receipt asserted `am-slm-next`.

    Args:
        target: A resolved manifest.

    Returns:
        ``{VAR: value}``, empty when nothing is declared.

    Raises:
        EngineEnvError: When a declared variable is one this adapter derives from components.
