"""Per-run progress heartbeat -- so `memrank ps` can see how a running eval is going.

Each ``memrank submit`` writes/updates a ``runs/<run-id>/status.json`` heartbeat as it progresses.
A run is one target x one benchmark: a comma sweep is N runs, each with its own heartbeat, executed
sequentially by one process (the not-yet-started ones sit in ``queued``). This is engine-agnostic:
it tracks the *eval script* (units ingested/retrieved), not how the engine executes (docker
container, fetched binary, or in-process baseline). The eval loop reaches this file through
`memrank.orchestration.observers.RunStatusObserver` -- one explicit object per run, handed to
`run_cell` -- never through module state.

Liveness in :func:`active_runs` is a fact-check (``os.kill(pid, 0)`` + heartbeat freshness), not a
timing-based wait.

    S3 is the floor. The task holds ``s3:PutObject`` on ``cloud-runs/*`` and that grant already
    exists, so the record lands whether or not an API is reachable, whether or not the deployment
    wires an event transport, and whether or not this build knows about the ingest route. Every
    reader that polls -- `ps`, `watch` against an older server -- keeps working from it alone.

    The POST is the live path. It carries the same record to
    :mod:`memrank.api.run_progress`, which is the only thing that publishes to the event bus, so
    the browser and a streaming `watch` see a sample in about a second instead of on the next
    poll. The task holds a RUN TOKEN for this and nothing else: it names one run, expires, and
    reaches exactly one route. It is emphatically not a bus credential -- the reasons are in
    :mod:`memrank.api.run_tokens`, and the short version is that a producer able to write the
    stream directly is a producer able to forge any event on it.

    BEST-EFFORT BY DESIGN, and the only deliberate swallow in this path: a progress write that
    fails must not fail an evaluation that is otherwise fine. Losing a progress update costs a
    stale bar for one interval; raising here would discard a run that has done real work. The
    caller's own failures still propagate -- this catches nothing but its own publishing.
