"""Local run registry -- accumulate every ``memrank submit`` for later comparison.

``memrank submit`` keeps writing its "latest" per-cell file to ``--output-dir`` (overwritten),
AND additionally snapshots each run into ``runs/<run-id>/`` here, so history piles up instead
of being clobbered. ``list-runs`` browses it and ``compare-versions`` reads from it.

Root is ``runs/`` (repo-relative), overridable via ``MEMRANK_RUNS_DIR`` -- the test suite points
that at a tmp dir so it never writes into the repo. This is a LOCAL filesystem registry; it is
unrelated to the object-storage ``runs/<sha>.json`` leaderboard prefix.
