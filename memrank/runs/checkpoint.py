"""What a run knew immediately before it started judging, written to disk.

A run holds every retrieved document in memory and writes its artifact exactly once, after judging.
So a crash in the judge stage -- the LAST stage, and the one with the least test exposure -- discards
the ingest and retrieval that paid for it. On 2026-08-12 that cost 4h50m: 272 ingests and 4,620
retrieves completed, and the process died three seconds before the first judge call with nothing on
disk but a progress heartbeat.

This module writes the cell as it stands before judging, so `memrank ops rejudge` can finish it.
The checkpoint is deliberately NOT a partial artifact: `cloud_submit` joins evaluate and upload with
`&&` so a failed run cannot publish something a reader mistakes for a result, and a distinctly named
file keeps that rule rather than weakening it.

DOCUMENTS ARE STORED ONCE IN A TABLE, AND REFERENCED BY INDEX. An engine that returns its whole
bank for every query serialises the same text once per query: a real 15.13 MB artifact held 8.63 MB
of retrieved text carrying 0.07 MB of distinct content.

Storing the text once is only half of it. A first version keyed documents by sha256 and referenced
them by hash, and cut that artifact's rows from 12.89 MB to 7.03 MB -- a disappointing 1.8x, because
the REFERENCES are the bulk, not the text: 152 queries x 204 results is ~31,000 of them, and a
64-character digest is no smaller than the ~193-character document it stood in for. An integer index
is what actually collapses it.

Documents are keyed on `(id, content)`, never on either alone. In that same artifact 14 memory ids
carried more than one content, because the engine consolidates memories while it is being queried;
keying on id alone would silently pick one version, and keying on content alone would render a
consolidation as one memory vanishing and another appearing.

    into a table makes each reference a couple of characters.
