"""Bring a cloud run's artifacts down into its local run directory.

The mirror image of ``deploy/upload_results.py``, which the task runs on success. Once the files
land in ``runs/<id>/``, a cloud run is indistinguishable from a local one to ``list-runs``,
``compare``, ``report`` and ``leaderboard-ingest`` -- no ``aws s3 cp`` step, no second code path.

Deliberately NOT part of :class:`~memrank.leaderboard.storage.S3Storage`. That class implements the
leaderboard's content-addressed ``runs/<sha256>.json`` contract and scopes every listing to it;
teaching it about ``cloud-runs/`` would widen a class whose narrowness is the point. This mirrors
the uploader instead, and inherits its one hard rule.

# Raw cloud-run artifacts live here. NEVER "runs/": that prefix belongs to leaderboard-gc, which
# deletes any object without a matching lb.run_artifacts row, and a raw cloud upload never has one
# (deploy/upload_results.py:28-32). Stated here too because this module reads what that one wrote,
# and a disagreement between them would look like a missing result rather than a wrong prefix.
ARTIFACT_PREFIX = "cloud-runs"

#: Directory each question's detail object is written under, relative to the run's artifact
#: prefix: ``detail/<target>__<benchmark>/<query_id>.json``. Per cell, because two engines in one
#: run answer the same ``query_id`` -- a flat ``detail/q1.json`` would let whichever cell was
#: written second silently claim the other's evidence.
DETAIL_DIRNAME = "detail"

#: Where a cell's corpus is written: ``corpus/<target>__<benchmark>.json``. Beside the details
#: rather than inside them, because it is the one object every question in the cell shares -- a

CORPUS_DIRNAME = "corpus"

# Both live HERE, with the prefix they hang off, rather than in `memrank.analysis.question_detail`
# where they were written. They are a storage LAYOUT fact, and the layout has two readers on
# opposite sides of the public boundary: `runs/reconcile.py` skips these directories on sync (the
# CLI never wants them), and `api/results_repository.py` serves out of them. Keeping them in
# `analysis/` made a published module import an unpublished package for two strings -- see
# localdocs/plans/2026-08-25-repo-boundary-execution-plan.md.
