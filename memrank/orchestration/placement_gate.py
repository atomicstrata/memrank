    same time -- which is what the blanket refusal here used to guard against. Comparing an engine
    you just wrote a translator for against the catalog is the whole point of having one, and
    refusing it protected nothing: quality compares across all of them, and latency is already kept
    honest by the declared transport class rather than by which targets ran together.
