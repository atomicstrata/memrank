"""The run lifecycle: everything a recorded run wires AROUND the eval library.

What belongs here: the observers that bridge `memrank.evaluation`'s narration into the
terminal and the run heartbeat, and (as the runner split proceeds) target resolution,
sweep execution, persistence, sync and cloud submission. What does not: the measurement
loop itself (`memrank.evaluation`) and Typer -- refusals raise `MemrankError` subclasses
and the CLI translates them at its boundary.
