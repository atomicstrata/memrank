"""The CLI's ears on the eval loop: terminal echoes and the run heartbeat.

`ConsoleObserver` narrates to the terminal exactly as the loop always has -- same
strings, same ``max(1, total // 10)`` throttle. `RunStatusObserver` adds the heartbeat:
the run's progress model, ``status.json`` updates, and the (env-gated) remote publish a
cloud task performs. Together they are the CLI's replacement for the module-global
"current run" -- one explicit object per run instead of process state.

Thread-safety: methods are called from worker threads (``workers>1``,
``judge_workers>1``). ``RunStatus`` and ``RunProgress`` carry their own locks, and the
observer holds no other mutable state after ``planned`` -- which runs before any pool
starts, the same ordering contract the globals relied on.
