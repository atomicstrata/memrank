"""Core abstractions for Memrank.

Defines ``Benchmark``, and re-exports the memory contract that ``Memory`` defines in
:mod:`memrank.instrument.kinds` -- under that name and under its deprecated spellings,
``MemoryAdapter`` and ``MemoryEngine``. The value types the two contracts exchange --
``Document``, ``Recall``, ``AdapterResponse``, ``BenchmarkUnit``, ``EvalInfo`` and the
required metric keys -- live in :mod:`memrank.contract` and are re-exported here too, which
is where every caller has always imported them from.

The ABCs are intentionally minimal. A memory wraps a memory engine; benchmarks
wrap a dataset + scorer. Everything else (latency capture, token capture,
receipt generation) is composed around them by the runner.
