"""The systems memrank ships, as classes -- `from memrank.systems import WordOverlap`.

`memrank.system("word-overlap")` needs the string first, and a string is not navigable: nothing
in an editor follows it, and nothing tells a reader what else is out there. Here the same
systems are Python names, so "go to definition" lands on the class, hover shows its docstring,
and autocomplete lists the catalog.

Each name below is the class's own name: `memrank/adapters/` defines `WordOverlap`, and this
module re-exports it. The suffixed spellings those classes used to carry -- `WordOverlapAdapter`
and its eight siblings -- remain importable from `memrank.adapters` as deprecated aliases of the
same class objects, so nothing is duplicated, every registered adapter keeps working, and the
command line keeps the older spellings it prints.

============  =======  ===============================================================
name          kind     what it needs
============  =======  ===============================================================
WordOverlap   memory   nothing -- in-process, offline
NoContext     control  nothing -- the floor: retrieves nothing, answers closed-book
FixedContext  control  nothing -- the corpus unranked, capped by the token budget
FullContext   control  nothing -- the corpus uncapped: the ceiling retrieval aims at
AtomicMemory  memory   a running engine, at `base_url=` or ATOMICMEMORY_API_URL
Hindsight     memory   a running engine, at `base_url=` or HINDSIGHT_API_URL
Supermemory   memory   a running engine, at `base_url=` or SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL
Mem0          memory   the mem0 SDK, or a running engine at MEM0_HTTP_URL
Native        memory   a running translator of memrank's system contract, NATIVE_API_URL
============  =======  ===============================================================

A control is not a memory system. It exists so a number has something to mean: a system that
does not beat `NoContext` has not earned its tokens, and `FullContext` is what retrieval is
trying to reach. `memrank.catalog()` prints this table at runtime.
