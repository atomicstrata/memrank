"""Experiment tracking -- mirroring finished runs into MLflow.

memrank's own run registry is the source of truth; this package is a one-way mirror for teams who
already read their experiments somewhere else. `export` walks the local registry and writes one
MLflow run per result cell, idempotently, so re-running it converges rather than duplicating.

The command that first pulls cloud runs down from object storage and then hands them to `export`
is :mod:`memrank.ops.mlflow_sync`, on the operator side. It used to live here as `sync`, which put
an internal-only module inside a package the CLI publishes, and that is why it moved. The
direction of the dependency is unchanged -- `ops` knows about `tracking`, never the reverse.

MLflow is an optional dependency, imported lazily. Nothing else in memrank may depend on this
package -- the mirror is allowed to know about the registry, never the reverse.
