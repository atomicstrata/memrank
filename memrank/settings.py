"""Standing user preferences -- the defaults that make routing flags disappear.

Distinct from :mod:`memrank.config`, which answers *what is this deployment wired to* (database
URLs, buckets, the API address) from an env file services override wholesale and that holds
credentials. This answers *what does this user want by default*: per-user rather than
per-checkout, written by a command rather than by hand, and never holding a secret. A preference
command rewriting a file full of DSNs is the accident this separation prevents.

Values resolve environment -> file -> shipped default, and every read reports **which** answered.
The environment wins because ``MEMRANK_API_URL=... memrank ...`` is how the runbooks work and must
keep working; a setting whose source is invisible is one the user cannot reason about when it
surprises them.

The store is ``config.json`` beside the local wallet in
:func:`memrank.secrets.wallet.config_dir`, written with the same atomic ``0600`` replace.
