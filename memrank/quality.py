"""What a quality number IS, what it is NOT, and when material cannot be frozen.

The honest caveat about memrank's cheapest number -- *retrieval recall (a substring proxy),
not end-to-end answer correctness* -- was one string in a dict keyed by metric name, read by
the terminal and by nothing else. A person holding a result could not reach it, so the
result's ``quality_metric: "substring_recall"`` had to be self-explanatory, which is the
thing that very constant exists to deny.

:class:`MetricDeclaration` splits that prose into its parts, so a result can carry them by
name. ``core.QUALITY_METRIC_LABELS`` and ``core.QUALITY_METRIC_DESCRIPTIONS`` are DERIVED
from the table below and are byte-identical to the literals they replaced --
``tests/core/test_quality_declarations.py`` pins that -- so every existing reader is
untouched.

A leaf module on purpose: it imports nothing from memrank, so ``core`` (which owns the
benchmark contract) and ``evaluation.result`` (which owns the artifact) can both read it
without either importing the other.
