"""System -- the thing under test, and the kinds a person subclasses.

The kind IS the base class, so a kind cannot be declared wrong. Each kind's required verbs are
abstract: a class that does not supply one cannot be instantiated, and a run refuses before
touching anything when the verb is missing all the same, so the reason is stated rather than
inferred from a TypeError.

The optional declarations -- version, token usage, internal timing, stored state -- are plain
methods returning ``None``. Declaring nothing is recorded as nothing, never as zero.

`Memory` is not defined here. There is ONE memory contract, `memrank.core.MemoryAdapter`, and
`memrank.instrument.kinds` exports it under the new kind name as the same class object; the
rename proper is a later ticket, and the CLI keeps its names until then.
