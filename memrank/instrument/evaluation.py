"""Evaluation -- a named, versioned bundle: tasks, the measures it ships with, the rule
for when the system's state is cleared, and the verb that applies it to a system.

The thing a person brings, reuses or publishes. memrank's evaluations and private ones are the
same kind of thing, which is why `memrank.evaluation("demo")` returns exactly what a person
writes by hand.

`evaluation.run(system=...)` is how an evaluation is applied. The verb lives on the evaluation
because that is where a reader holding one goes looking for it, and because the import path
then carries the model: a free function taking both objects says nothing about which argument
is which, which is the confusion it was observed to cause (decision 0008).

Scoring is not here. An evaluation bundles measures; the measures decide.
