"""The two readings a paired comparison needs, and nothing that draws a conclusion.

Both are the standard forms for paired data, and both are computed exactly rather than
approximated:

- **McNemar's exact test** over the discordant pairs of a binary measure -- the exact binomial
  two-sided tail, never the chi-square approximation, which is the approximation that misleads
  precisely where the discordant count is small (NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical
  Methods, section 7.3.5, McNemar's test).
- **A paired bootstrap percentile interval** for a continuous measure's mean difference,
  resampling task-pairs together and clustering by group where tasks share one, because tasks
  of one group are not independent draws (Miller, *Adding Error Bars to Evals*, 2024).

Deterministic: the bootstrap's seed and resample count are arguments, and the reading records
both, so the same two results always produce the same interval.
