"""`memrank.evaluation("demo")` and `memrank.system("word-overlap")` -- the shipped names.

Two constructors, one idea: the things memrank ships are reached by the catalog name they are
printed under, so the first line a person copies stays inside the seven words. `system` hands
back a constructed shipped system; `evaluation` converts an in-tree benchmark into an
`Evaluation`.

memrank's own evaluations and a person's are the same kind of thing, so this produces exactly
what a person writes by hand: tasks, measures, a clearing rule. One group per unit, the unit's
documents as the group's context, and the benchmark's own `score()` wrapped as one measure
beside the measures that need no answer writer.

What does not convert is carried honestly rather than approximated: a benchmark whose span
proxy is meaningless (`substring_recall_supported = False`) ships no `WordMatch`, and nothing
here judges, because judging needs an answer and an answer needs a writer and a key.

`catalog()` is the third door and the one that presupposes nothing: it prints what ships, under
both the string names these two take and the Python names `memrank.systems` and
`memrank.evaluations` carry, which is where an editor can follow them.
