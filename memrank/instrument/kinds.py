"""`Memory`, the memory kind: you tell it things, and later you ask it for what is relevant.

The one memory contract is DEFINED here, under the kind's own name. `memrank.core` imports it
and keeps `MemoryAdapter` and `MemoryEngine` as deprecated aliases of this same class object,
so `isinstance(x, MemoryAdapter)`, every registered adapter and every out-of-tree subclass keep
holding; the CLI keeps its own nouns.

It lives here rather than in `system.py` because it needs the value types in `memrank.contract`
and `system.py` is what `memrank.core` imports; one module per kind that carries a contract
keeps the dependency pointing one way -- `core` -> `kinds` -> `system`.

        retrying is safe.

        mem0's ``add()`` is three steps -- extract, reconcile, then a loop that writes. A failure in
        the first two wrote nothing and a retry is exactly equivalent to never having failed. A
