"""The seven: system, evaluation, task, trace, measure, run, result.

The conceptual model these implement is
`docs-internal/directions/2026-09-21-memrank-abstractions.md` and decision 0009; one module
per noun, and the names here are the words in that record.

Nothing is imported eagerly. `memrank.core` imports `memrank.instrument.system`, so a package
body that reached back into `memrank.core` would close the loop -- and `import memrank` stays
as light as it was, with the loop loading only when a run is asked for.

`memrank/instrument/` rather than `memrank/model/`: "model" is already a kind of system here,
and in the field at large it means the thing being run, not the frame it is run in. memrank
calls itself an instrument, and these are the parts of the instrument.

#: The nouns, by name. The VERBS -- `run`, `measure`, `evaluation`, `paired` -- are not here:
#: each shares its name with the module it lives in, and an imported submodule shadows a
#: package attribute, so `memrank.instrument.run` is the module and always will be. A person
#: reaches the verbs at `memrank.run`, `memrank.measure`, `memrank.evaluation`,
#: `memrank.paired`, which resolve straight to the leaf modules.
