"""Why a run refuses, worked out before the system is touched.

A refusal is a result with no traces and a stated reason. The three things checked here are
the three the model names: the system must be a kind memrank knows and must supply that kind's
required verbs; every measure must read trace fields and value names something produces; and
the material an evaluation carries must have a verb to be given through.

The fourth is the answer writer (H1): when the system only recalls and a measure reads
``answered``, something has to write the answer, and memrank ships no reader that runs
in-process without a key -- so it refuses and names what to pass rather than inventing one.
