"""Memrank CLI + orchestrator.

Entry point:
    memrank submit mem0 locomo:smoke --seed 42
    memrank submit atomicmemory beam:100k-smoke
    memrank submit word-overlap demo --on cloud --org atomicstrata
    memrank evals ls
    memrank runs ls

The runner is deliberately small. The bulk of the work lives in the
adapter/benchmark contracts; the runner just glues the lifecycle together,
captures latency/token metrics, and writes a reproducibility receipt.

Operator and cross-record-analysis commands (``leaderboard*``, ``arena*``, ``compare``,
``report``, ``compare-versions``, ``mlflow-sync``) used to live here. They now live in
:mod:`memrank.ops`, reached through ``scripts/internal/memrank-ops.py`` -- ``memrank`` shows exactly
one product. See docs-internal/interface-model.md section 7.
