"""The CLI's one-shot loopback callback server for the PKCE login flow.

RFC 8252 endorses this shape -- a native app receives its authorization code on a loopback
redirect -- because the response never leaves the machine. Two details carry that guarantee
and both are easy to get wrong:

- **Bind 127.0.0.1, never 0.0.0.0.** Listening on all interfaces would let anything on the
  local network receive the code. This is the most common mistake in the pattern.
- **Port 0.** The kernel assigns a free port, so two concurrent logins cannot collide and
  nothing needs a fixed port reserved. The API accepts any loopback port precisely so this
  works, which is why the CLI talks to our API rather than to GitHub directly.

The port is open only for the duration of one login and closes on exit from the context
manager, whether the flow succeeded or not.
