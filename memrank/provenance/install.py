"""Where this install came from -- and, when it is too old, where a newer one comes from.

``memrank version`` printing ``0.2.0`` and nothing else is useless the moment there is a
second user: the version in ``pyproject.toml`` moves rarely and the install branch moves
daily, so two people on different commits report the same string and a bug report cannot be
tied to code. This is the same failure :func:`memrank._installed_version` was written to
prevent, one level up -- there the version disagreed with the install, here the version
cannot distinguish two installs.

PEP 610 answers it without any build machinery: pip and uv both write ``direct_url.json``
beside the installed metadata, recording the URL a distribution was installed from and, for a
VCS install, the *resolved* commit. Standard metadata is deliberate -- uv's own
``uv-receipt.toml`` is private to uv and records the ref that was *requested* (``@dev``),
which is precisely the thing that cannot identify a build.

A distribution installed from a plain wheel or sdist has no ``direct_url.json`` at all; that
is a fact about the install, not an error, and it reads back as "no origin to report".
