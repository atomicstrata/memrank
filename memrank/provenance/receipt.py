"""Reproducibility receipt format.

A receipt is the structured metadata block published alongside every
Memrank result. The vendor-neutral charter requires that no number is
published without one. The receipt makes the run reproducible: third
parties can re-execute with the same adapter/engine/dataset versions and
should get the same composite within published noise.

# masquerade as a change in the system under test.
#
#   1  (2026-07-30) first versioned scheme. Same run recorded before vs after this session's target
#      work hashes differently: ``config.components`` moved from ambient environment to target
#      manifests, gained ``embedder.provider``, and gained ``verified``. Anything written earlier
#      reads back as version 0 and is NOT comparable to a version-1 record.
#   2  bumped without a note. Left as found rather than back-filled with a guess -- inventing the
#      reason would be worse than recording that it is unknown.
#   3  (2026-08-10) ``config.target`` is now recorded for EVERY target, where it used to appear
#      only for source-bound ones (runner.py:_build_receipt). Container targets -- mem0, hindsight,
#      supermemory -- previously hashed without their manifest, so two runs of the same engine at
#      different retrieval depths were indistinguishable (audit F16). A version-2 record and a
#      version-3 record of the same run therefore differ by construction.
#   4  (2026-08-12) BEAM records ``config.beam_protocol`` (benchmarks/beam.py:config_for_receipt).
#      BEAM's reference harness contradicts BEAM's paper in three places, so "a BEAM score" names
#      two different metrics; without this field two runs under different protocols collide on one
#      hash. Only BEAM carries the key, but the SCHEME changed for everything, which is what a
#      version is for.
#   5  (2026-08-13) Judged configs record ``config.answer_temperature`` (reader pinned at 0;
#      runner.py:_judge_receipt_config), and BEAM records ``config.time_anchors`` /
#      ``config.context_policy`` (benchmarks/beam.py:config_for_receipt) -- the run-protocol facts
#      behind decision-beam-runs-its-own-protocol.md. A version-4 BEAM record describes a run with
#      rendered anchors and a capped reader; a version-5 record describes role+content, uncapped.
#   6  (2026-08-13) LoCoMo records ``config.locomo_dataset_sha256``
#      (benchmarks/locomo.py:config_for_receipt): the digest of the file actually scored, so two
#      artifacts share a config hash only on identical data. A version-5 LoCoMo record predates
#      the corrected category mapping (LoCoMoBenchmark.VERSION = 1) -- its per-category labels
#      are void and its judged denominator was 603 of 1,540.
#   7  (2026-08-14) LongMemEval records ``config.longmemeval_dataset_sha256``
#      (benchmarks/longmemeval.py:config_for_receipt). It matters more here than for LoCoMo,
#      which has one upstream commit ever: this dataset has shipped three named revisions, the
#      original now carries a deprecation banner, and a third-party re-review found 15.4% of the
#      cleaned file's records wrong. A version-6 LongMemEval record cannot say which artifact it
#      scored. Its slices also differ -- version-6 smoke/mini were `raw[:N]` over a type-grouped
#      file, so both covered one of six question types and no abstention item.
