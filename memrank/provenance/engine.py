"""Engine provenance facet -- which exact engine artifact ran and how it derives
from upstream.

Every receipt records *config* but, until now, only a weak engine identity
(``engine_version``, ``"unknown"`` locally, and no image digest). This module
builds a standards-shaped provenance block so a run pins the exact engine build
and its lineage. The representation is deliberately NOT bespoke -- it mirrors what
SBOM tools (Syft, Trivy) emit:

- **Identity/location = Package URL (purl, ECMA-427).** For a container the image
  *digest is the version* (``pkg:oci/<name>@sha256:<digest>?repository_url=...&tag=...``)
  -- the immutable, registry-agnostic pin. Source built from a public repository is its own
  ``pkg:github/...@<sha>`` purl; a closed binary is ``pkg:generic/...``.
- **A source repository that is not public is never named.** A receipt is read by people who
  cannot clone it, and a name they cannot resolve identifies nothing while disclosing where our
  code lives. Such a source becomes ``pkg:generic/<name>@<commit>`` with no location qualifier,
  plus ``memrank:source_visibility=private``: the commit still pins the exact tree, and the
  lineage that makes a patched engine reproducible -- the upstream ancestor purl and the patch
  set in ``pedigree`` -- is public and survives intact.
- **Derivation = CycloneDX ``pedigree`` + ``manufacturer``/``supplier``.** A fork
  carries ``pedigree.ancestors`` (the upstream purl) + ``patches``; "our fork vs a
  vendor mirror" is the manufacturer (who built the image) vs supplier (who
  distributes it) distinction. So fork/mirror/our-source is *derived*
  (:func:`derive_origin`), never a hand-rolled enum.
- **The one non-standard axis -- deployment model** (self-hosted OSS vs managed API
  vs embedded SDK) has no standard enum anywhere, so it lives in CycloneDX
  ``properties`` under a ``memrank:`` namespace, explicitly custom.

Following memrank's "operator-declared, not introspected" model, stable facts live
in the code-reviewed :data:`PROVENANCE` manifest and volatile pins (image digest,
source commit, dirty flag) are injected at run time via ``{prefix}ENGINE_*`` env
vars by the build/orchestration scripts, then merged by :func:`build_provenance`.
