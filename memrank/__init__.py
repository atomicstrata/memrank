"""Memrank -- an open, vendor-neutral instrument: it measures how well a memory helps
answer questions about what it was told earlier.

You bring the engine, and your own tasks if you have them. Memrank brings everything
between: it gives the material, puts the tasks, records what happened, and applies the
measures that turn those records into named values. (A memory is one kind of system it
measures; `System` below names the others.)

    import memrank

    class MyMemory(memrank.Memory):
        ...                                        # the four verbs its kind requires

    result = memrank.run(MyMemory(), memrank.evaluation("demo"))
    result.values                                  # named values, each with its decider
    result.traces                                  # one per task per attempt, always

Seven things, and nothing else has to be learned:

- **system** -- the thing under test. Subclass the kind it is: ``Memory`` (tell it things, ask
  it for what is relevant, clear on request), ``Model``, ``Retriever`` or ``Assistant``. The
  required verbs are abstract; the optional declarations return ``None`` until you say.
  ``memrank.system("word-overlap")`` constructs one memrank ships, by the name
  ``memrank list-adapters`` prints.
- **evaluation** -- a named, versioned bundle: its tasks, the measures it ships with, and the
  rule for when state is cleared. ``memrank.evaluation("demo")`` builds one from an in-tree
  benchmark; ``memrank.Evaluation(...)`` is the same object, written by hand.
- **task** -- one thing to put to the system: the context, the prompt, what is expected.
- **trace** -- everything observed while one task ran. Exactly one per task per attempt,
  including on failure.
- **measure** -- a named rule from traces to values, declaring what it reads and who decides.
  ``WordMatch``, ``Judge``, ``Latency``, ``FailureRate``.
- **run** -- the act: ``run(system, evaluation)``. It refuses BEFORE touching the system when
  the run cannot be set up, and returns a result with no traces and a stated reason.
- **result** -- the traces and the values, each value carrying its measure's name and its
  decider. Never a bare number, and never a verdict.

Two things sit above the seven: ``memrank.measure(result, MyMeasure())`` applies a measure
thought of later to stored traces, and ``memrank.paired(a, b)`` reads two results of the same
evaluation side by side. Neither says "better".

The previous Python surface has not been taken away, only moved off the front page:
``memrank.evaluation.api.run`` still produces the ``EvalResult`` the command line and the
cloud read, and ``MemoryAdapter``, ``Benchmark``, ``EvalResult``, ``SpanRecall``,
``ComposedEvaluation`` and the sub-nouns are still importable from here and from their own
modules.

# Every name below is a plain import, so "go to definition" lands on the class or the function
# and a type checker sees the real signature. They were resolved through a module-level
# `__getattr__` until this commit, which is invisible to every editor: command-click on
# `memrank.run` went nowhere and hover showed nothing.
#
# The nine spelled `X as X` are not in `__all__`, and the redundant alias is what says
# "deliberately re-exported" to the linter and to a reader -- these are the deprecated
# spellings and the sub-nouns, not names this module forgot to use.

#: `memrank.evaluation` is BOTH the constructor of the seven and the name of the package the
#: cell run lives in, and an imported submodule wins: importing `memrank.evaluation.api` makes
#: the import machinery rebind `evaluation` in this module's `__dict__` to the package. A plain
#: import does not make that go away -- it is a write over the name the import above bound, and
#: it was measured here before this line was restored: `memrank.evaluation("demo")` raised
#: `'module' object is not callable`, and only once the import order happened to put the
#: package first. So the shadowing guard stays, and it holds the function in a private name the
#: import machinery has no reason to touch.
#:
#: It costs nothing an editor can see. The plain import above is what "go to definition", hover
#: and autocomplete read, and this only decides which object wins at RUNTIME. Both halves hold:
#: `memrank.evaluation` is the function, and the package is still importable by its full name,
#: `from memrank.evaluation.api import run`.
