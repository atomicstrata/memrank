"""Structured, presentation-neutral target and eval discovery.

Presentation-neutral in both directions: this describes what a deployment can run, and every
consumer decides how to say it. ``memrank evals show`` renders these dicts for a terminal, the
API serves them as JSON, and the browser fills its pickers from them -- one description, three
renderings, so a picker cannot offer an eval the harness does not have.

That is also why :func:`describe_eval` lives here rather than in ``evals_cli``, where it started:
a Typer module is a rendering, and the API cannot import one to answer a question about the
catalog.
