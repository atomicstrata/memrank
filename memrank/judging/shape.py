"""How a benchmark's answers are graded -- the shape of judging, not its prompts.

Every benchmark used one grading shape: generate an answer from the retrieved context, ask a
judge one question about it, get one boolean. That is right for LoCoMo and LongMemEval, whose
questions each have a single gold answer.

It is not what BEAM specifies. BEAM scores against a `rubric` of atomic nuggets -- one judge call
PER NUGGET, each scored {0, 0.5, 1}, averaged within the question
(docs-internal/benchmarks/benchmark-beam.md section 3). That is a different shape, not a different prompt: N calls
where there was one, and a mean where there was a boolean. There was nowhere to say it. The runner's
judge path is benchmark-agnostic by construction, so the only way to express it was to branch on
benchmark name inside the runner -- which is the thing this seam exists to prevent.

`docs/adding-benchmarks.md` told benchmark authors to accept an injectable `judge` callable, and
`memrank/benchmarks/beam.py` promised the same. Neither existed. This is that promise, made real
and made narrower: a benchmark declares its shape, and the runner asks the shape both what a query
COSTS and what grading one YIELDS. The cost half matters as much as the grading half -- a preflight
that cannot size the shape it is about to run quotes a budget the run does not honour.
