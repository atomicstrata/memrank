"""Anthropic-backed completer with response-only caching and a billable-call counter.

The counter sits at the single egress point so a judged run reports exactly what it spent. It used
to be a hard CAP as well; that ceiling is gone, because bounding the scorer would have made which
queries got graded depend on where a counter ran out. What a run costs is bounded by choosing how
many units to run, which is where every evaluation framework puts it.

The cache stores only the response keyed by a content hash -- the prompt body (which may contain
memory content) is never persisted.

    This used to be ``capped_completer``, raising once a ceiling was passed. The ceiling is gone: it
    bounded the MEASUREMENT rather than the system under test, and which queries got graded would
    have depended on where a counter ran out -- on ordering, not on quality. No evaluation framework
    caps its scorer; they bound examples instead, which memrank spells `--unit` and its eval slices.
    Nor was there a runaway to catch: gradings per query are fixed by the shape, queries by the
    slice, and a verdict is re-asked at most ``judge.MAX_VERDICT_ATTEMPTS`` times, so spend is
    bounded by construction. Measured, a judge that never returns parseable JSON spends LESS than
    the plan, because a grading that exhausts its attempts abandons the rest of its query.

    The lock stays, because the count outlived the cap and is now the receipt's `judge_calls_made`.
    Read-modify-write across judge workers drops increments, and a spend figure that under-reports
    is worse than none. It is held only around the counter, never across ``inner`` -- holding it over
    the API call would serialise judging back into what that concurrency exists to escape.

    `UnparseableVerdict`, so a 429 propagates and kills the run in its LAST stage, after every
