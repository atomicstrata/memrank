"""Versioned, published judge/answer prompts.

These prompts are a methodology artifact (vendor-neutral charter): they are
checked into the repo and versioned by ``JUDGE_PROMPT_VERSION``. Changing a
prompt is a methodology change (RFC + version bump), not a silent edit.

All engine-/answer-derived text is placed inside a delimited untrusted-data
block and the system prompts state that block content is data to evaluate,
never instructions to follow (prompt-injection defense).

# Methodology version for judged scoring. Bumped when prompts OR the judged
# scope change (so receipts/cache discriminate). 2026-06-04.1: expanded
# JUDGE_VALID_CATEGORIES to cover binary-suitable BEAM abilities. 2026-06-04.2:
# every untrusted field (question/reference/memory/candidate) is now wrapped in a
# labeled sentinel block with embedded-sentinel neutralization, and multi-sample
# grading uses a per-sample prompt suffix (so the response cache no longer
# collapses N samples to one). Both change prompt bytes -> version bump.
# 2026-08-10.1: expanded JUDGE_VALID_CATEGORIES to cover LongMemEval's six question types. No
# prompt bytes change, but the judged SCOPE does -- LongMemEval was previously unjudgeable in full
# (0 judgeable queries), so a receipt or a cache entry from before this version describes a
# different set of questions than one after it.
# 2026-08-12.1: added NUGGET_SYSTEM, a per-criterion grader on a {0, 0.5, 1} scale, for BEAM's
# rubric protocol (localdocs/benchmarks/benchmark-beam.md section 3). New prompt bytes AND a new judged scope:
# BEAM previously graded one holistic verdict against a reference answer, and now grades each
# rubric nugget. A BEAM receipt or cache entry from before this version describes a different
# METRIC, not just a different question set.
# 2026-08-12.2: added EVENT_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM and EQUIVALENCE_SYSTEM for BEAM's event_ordering
# ability, which is scored by rank correlation rather than by averaging criteria. Scope change as
# well as new bytes: event_ordering was previously never judged at all, so a BEAM run before this
# version covered nine abilities and one after it covers ten.
# 2026-08-13.1: answer-model calls are now pinned at temperature 0 (JudgeConfig.answer_temperature,
# judge_client.sampling_params). Not a byte change to any prompt -- a change to the sampling those
# prompts run under, which the cache key does not carry, so a cached provider-default answer must
# not serve a pinned run. Judge-model calls are unchanged (claude-opus-4-8 rejects the parameter).
# 2026-08-13.2: the reader learns the date. `answer_user` gains an optional wrapped
# "Current date" block fed from the query's `query_timestamp` (LoCoMo audit F4; LongMemEval
# section 2.4 "no current date" row), ANSWER_SYSTEM explains it, and LoCoMo's loader appends the
# official date-instruction suffix to temporal question text. New prompt bytes for every dated
# query AND changed question text for 321 LoCoMo questions -- cached answers from before this
# version were produced by a reader that did not know when "now" was.
# 2026-08-14.1: LongMemEval's six official judge prompts (LME_PROMPTS) are adopted verbatim from
# `evaluate_qa.py::get_anscheck_prompt`, dispatched per question type with abstention overriding
# type. `correctness_user` gains `gold_label` so the reference can be named Rubric or Explanation
# rather than "Reference answer" -- for two of the six types it is not an answer at all. New
# prompt bytes AND a new judged scope for LongMemEval: 12% of the benchmark was previously graded
# against the wrong object and 43% without its type's licensed tolerance. Other benchmarks' bytes
# are UNCHANGED (they pass no prompts and take the generic pair), but the cache key is prefixed
# with this constant, so their cached verdicts are invalidated too -- a cost, not a correctness
# issue, accepted deliberately so the receipt can distinguish the two grading regimes.

#: LongMemEval's six official judge prompts, from `src/evaluation/evaluate_qa.py`
#: (`get_anscheck_prompt`), reproduced as paper Figure 10 and in
#: localdocs/benchmarks/benchmark-longmemeval.md section 3.
#:
#: These are the only prompts in memrank with a PUBLISHED HUMAN-AGREEMENT FIGURE -- 97-98% against
#: human experts (paper Table 6), weakest on preference and abstention at 0.90 each. Neither
#: LoCoMo nor BEAM publishes any such figure. That is why they are adopted verbatim rather than
#: paraphrased into memrank's house style: the wording IS the validated instrument.
#:
#: Two caveats ride with them and are recorded here so nobody has to rediscover them.
#: (1) The agreement figure was measured under `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` and does NOT transfer to a
#:     different judge model. memrank runs claude-opus-4-8 until the completer is
#:     provider-pluggable (decision-longmemeval-runs-the-official-protocol.md, item 3).
#: (2) Three of the six types share one default prompt; what varies is a single added clause.
#:     Those clauses are the whole point -- they are what makes 43% of the benchmark gradeable
#:     under the rules its authors actually wrote.
#:
#: Each entry is (system prompt, label for the reference field). The label is load-bearing: the
#: official prompts call the reference "Correct Answer", "Rubric" or "Explanation" depending on
#: type, because for two of the six it is NOT an answer -- preference ships a description of the
#: desired personalisation and abstention ships an explanation of why the premise is false.
#: Grading either against a "does this match the reference answer" prompt grades the wrong object.

#: Grades ONE rubric nugget, on BEAM's three-point scale.
#:
#: Three things here are load-bearing and each corresponds to a clause of BEAM's own judge prompt
#: (localdocs/benchmarks/benchmark-beam.md section 3):
#:
#: - **The 0.5 band.** BEAM's paper and prompt both define it; their shipped code discards it with
#:   `int()`. We honour it, per decision-beam-targets-the-spec-not-the-harness.
#: - **Negative criteria.** BEAM expresses abstention and instruction/preference compliance through
#:   rubric WORDING ("should abstain", "should not..."), not a separate grader, so one prompt has to
#:   read criteria in both directions. This is why the two compliance abilities need no gold answer.
#: - **Responsiveness.** A response that ignores the question satisfies nothing, or a refusal would
#:   trivially satisfy every prohibition. BEAM's prompt says this and then never substitutes the
#:   question; we substitute it, which is what makes the clause mean anything.
NUGGET_SYSTEM = (
    "You grade whether a response satisfies ONE rubric criterion. "
    "Score 1 when the criterion is fully satisfied, 0.5 when it is partially satisfied "
    "(present but incomplete or partly inaccurate), and 0 when it is not satisfied. "
    "Judge by meaning, not wording: accept paraphrases, synonyms, and equivalent forms of "
    "numbers and dates. Ignore tone, length and formatting unless the criterion explicitly "
    "requires a format. "
    "A criterion phrased as a prohibition (\"should not\", \"avoid\", \"should abstain\") is "
    "satisfied when the response honours it AND still addresses the question; a response that "
    "does not address the question satisfies nothing. " + _INJECTION_GUARD + _NUGGET_JSON
)


#: Decomposes an answer into the events it lists, IN THE ORDER IT LISTS THEM.
#:
#: BEAM's harness calls its own fact-extraction prompt here and then discards the result, splitting
#: the response on newlines instead (card section 6c). Newline-splitting makes the metric a test of answer
#: formatting: the answer prompt is generic and never asks for one event per line, so a
#: well-ordered single paragraph collapses to one event and scores near zero for a reason that has
#: nothing to do with memory. We extract, per decision-beam-targets-the-spec-not-the-harness.
#:
#: JSON rather than their numbered-list format because a list has to be re-parsed out of prose,
#: and a parse failure here silently becomes a wrong score rather than an error.
EVENT_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM = (
    "You extract the distinct events or items a response lists, preserving the order in which the "
    "response presents them. One entry per event, each a short noun phrase naming that event and "
    "nothing else -- no numbering, no commentary. If the response lists no events, return an empty "
    "list. " + _INJECTION_GUARD
    + 'Respond with ONLY strict JSON: {"events": ["<first>", "<second>", ...]}.'
)

#: Decides whether a predicted event and a reference event are the same event.
#:
#: Kept deliberately narrow. This is the subjective step in the ordering metric -- everything after
#: it is arithmetic -- so it grades one pair at a time and says why, which is what makes a wrong
#: alignment findable in the artifact rather than only visible as a bad score.
EQUIVALENCE_SYSTEM = (
    "You decide whether two short descriptions refer to the SAME underlying event or topic. "
    "Judge by meaning: paraphrases, synonyms and differing levels of detail about the same event "
    "are the same event. Different events that merely happened close together, or that share a "
    "subject, are NOT the same event. " + _INJECTION_GUARD
