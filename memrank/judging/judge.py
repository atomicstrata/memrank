"""Pure, injectable LLM-judge scoring.

A ``Completer`` is ``(model, system, user) -> text``; all functions take one so
the judge is fully testable without the network. The Anthropic-backed completer
(with caching + a hard call cap) lives in ``judge_client``. Verdicts are strict JSON, bare or
inside a single markdown code fence; anything else raises (no silent fallback).
