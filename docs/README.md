# Documentation

Memrank is a tool for reproducible, auditable evaluation of memory systems.

Memrank focuses on memory systems: it runs evaluation tasks and reports scores and timings, with
recorded responses and errors to inspect. Use these results to understand how your memory system
performs, compare it with another memory system and investigate differences on individual tasks.

## Start a task

| I want to... | Start here |
|---|---|
| Try Memrank and understand the output | [Start here](getting-started.md): installation check, result interpretation and next steps |
| Install or upgrade the package | [Installing Memrank](install.md): project-local setup and an offline check |
| Compare memory systems and their versions | [Memory systems comparison guide](comparing.md): conditions, task-level pairing, differences and limitations |
| Connect my implementation | [Adding a system](systems.md): use a shipped client or implement the lifecycle |
| Use my own tasks and success criteria | [Adding an evaluation](evaluations.md): express your evaluation without registering it |
| Read, inspect or save a result | [Understand results](results.md): meanings, errors, missing values and stored traces |
| Run a complete script | [Runnable examples](../examples/README.md): small offline examples by task |

These guides use the Python interface. A **system** is the implementation you test; an **evaluation** supplies
tasks and measurement rules. The detailed definitions are available when you need them in the
[reference](reference/README.md).

## Understand the measurements

- [Understand results](results.md) explains what a value says, where it came from and what it
  cannot establish.
- [Methodology](methodology.md) describes scoring, context budgets, controls and evidence classes.
- [Measures](measures.md) explains how to implement a scoring rule or apply one to saved traces.
- [System lifecycle](systems.md#why-a-memory-has-four-methods) explains why Memrank separates
  preparation, ingestion, retrieval and cleanup.

## Command-line workflows

The command line provides tracked, named and placed runs. It uses its own vocabulary and result
format; follow its guide when using that interface rather than mixing its examples with the
Python result API.

| Task | Page |
|---|---|
| Submit, watch and inspect a tracked run | [The command line](misc/command-line.md) |
| Check container availability and prerequisites | [Engine images](misc/engine-images.md) |
| Register a system for command-line use | [Custom targets](../examples/more/custom-target/README.md) |

## Working on memrank itself

[Contributing and getting help](contributing.md) is the contributor entry point.
[Local development](local-development.md) covers checkout setup and checks;
[the test tree](../tests/README.md) explains where tests belong.
