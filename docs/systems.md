# Adding a system

A **[system](reference/system.md)** is the thing under test, and its kind is the class you
subclass, so a kind cannot be declared wrong. This page is the long version of that reference
page.

You do not have to put your system inside this package to run it, and you do not have to give it
a name. Pass the instance.

Memrank supplies everything around it: the run loop, isolation between groups of tasks, latency
and token instrumentation, cost accounting, the [measures](reference/measure.md) that turn what
was observed into named values, and the receipt that records what actually ran.

**One note on names.** The memory contract is defined as `Memory`, and `MemoryAdapter` and
`MemoryEngine` are deprecated aliases of that same class object, so every memory class already
written is a `Memory` and needs no edit. Write `memrank.Memory` in anything new. The nine shipped
systems dropped their `Adapter` suffix the same way, keeping the old spelling as an alias;
`memrank/adapters/__init__.py` lists them.

## The four kinds, and the verbs each one requires

The kind **is** the base class. `KIND_NAMES` and `REQUIRED_VERBS` in `memrank.instrument.system`
are where this table is stated; the memory contract itself lives in `memrank.instrument.kinds`,
because it is the one kind that needs the value types in `memrank.contract`.

| Kind | Subclass | What it is for | Verbs it must supply |
|---|---|---|---|
| memory | `memrank.Memory` | told things, asked later for what is relevant, cleared on request | `prepare`, `ingest`, `retrieve`, `cleanup` |
| model | `memrank.Model` | completes a prompt | `complete` |
| retriever | `memrank.Retriever` | ranks over a corpus it already holds; nothing is told to it | `rank` |
| assistant | `memrank.Assistant` | responds to a list of messages in the usual `role`/`content` shape | `respond` |

`kind_of` finds the kind by walking your class's MRO for one of those four, so you declare a kind
by subclassing and in no other way. A run works the consequences out **before it touches your
system** (`memrank/instrument/refusal.py`) and returns a refusal -- a result with no traces and a
stated reason -- rather than failing somewhere inside the loop. It refuses when the object is not
a `System` at all, when it subclasses `System` but none of the four kinds, and when it is a kind
whose required verb it does not supply.

Two refusals are about the fit between the system and the evaluation rather than about the class:

- an evaluation whose tasks carry **context** needs a kind that can be told things, which today
  is memory alone;
- a measure that reads `answered` needs a kind that answers -- model or assistant -- or an
  `answerer=` passed to the run, because a memory only recalls.

```python
import memrank


class Echo(memrank.Model):
    """A model that answers with the prompt it was given."""

    def complete(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        return prompt


result = memrank.evaluation("demo").run(system=Echo())
print(result.refused)
print(result.refusal)
```

Everything a system may say about **itself** is optional: `declared_version`, `declared_tokens`,
`declared_timings` and `declared_state` are plain methods on `System` that return `None` until
you write one, and declaring nothing is recorded as nothing, never as zero. The memory contract
keeps its own older spellings of the last three -- `token_metrics`, `declared_latency` and
`state_fingerprint` -- and memrank reads both, so an existing class needs no edit.

## 1. Run your own system: pass the instance

`evaluation.run(system=...)` takes the instance, so a system that exists only in your codebase
runs the same loop as the ones memrank ships:

```python
import memrank
from memrank import Document, Recall


class MyMemory(memrank.Memory):
    name = "myengine"           # a label on the result, not an address
    version = "0.1.0"           # your class's own version
    engine_version = "1.2.3"    # the engine you are wrapping

    def prepare(self, isolation_unit: str) -> None:
        self.held: list[Document] = []

    def ingest(self, documents: list[Document]) -> None:
        self.held.extend(documents)

    def retrieve(self, query: str, k: int, user_id: str,
                 query_timestamp=None) -> Recall:
        wanted = set(query.lower().split())
        ranked = sorted(self.held, reverse=True,
                        key=lambda held: len(wanted & set(held.content.lower().split())))
        return Recall(documents=ranked[:k])

    def cleanup(self) -> None:
        self.held = []


result = memrank.evaluation("demo").run(system=MyMemory())
print(result.values_of("demo-score")[0].value, result.system.name, result.system.kind)
```

Those four verbs are the whole third-party contract for the memory kind, and they are abstract:
a run refuses before touching anything when one is missing. [The translator
contract](system-contract.md) states each one in full.

`retrieve` returns a `Recall`: the documents in the order your system ranked them -- the order
**is** the measurement, so return at most `k` and never pad -- and `declared`, whatever your
system wants to say about the call, recorded untouched. Both halves land on the
[trace](reference/trace.md).

Nothing in those four verbs reports a measurement memrank takes itself: memrank times every
ingest and retrieve at its own call boundary, so latency is neither your job nor something your
system could flatter.

Nothing here touches the registry, the command line, a configuration setting or a file inside
`memrank/`. The evaluation the verb is called on is reached the same way:
`memrank.evaluation("demo")`, `memrank.evaluations.Demo()`, or an `Evaluation` of your own (see
[adding an evaluation](evaluations.md)).

The runnable version of exactly this, offline and in about a second, is
[`examples/02-your-own-system/`](../examples/02-your-own-system/README.md):

```bash
uv run python examples/02-your-own-system/run.py
```

**What the instance route does not reach.** A system passed as an object has no catalog ref, so
there is no address, no variant digest and no provenance for the build. `memrank submit`, cloud
placement and `workers > 1` all need a ref, and the run's evidence class is
`development_observation`, `publishable: false`. Reaching those means giving the system a name,
which is [not core](#not-core-registration-targets-and-the-command-line).

## 2. Declare what only your system knows

Latency is memrank's, taken at its own call boundary. What memrank cannot see, your system may
declare, and both declarations below are optional.

**Token usage** is the one measurement only a system can make, because only it is told what a
provider billed it. Record into a `TokenCollector` and return `self.tokens.as_metrics()` from
`token_metrics()` -- or from the kind-neutral `declared_tokens()`, which memrank reads first:

```python
import memrank
from memrank.instrumentation import TokenCollector


class MyMemory(memrank.Memory):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.tokens = TokenCollector()

    def prepare(self, isolation_unit: str) -> None: ...
    def ingest(self, documents) -> None: ...
    def retrieve(self, query, k, user_id, query_timestamp=None): ...
    def cleanup(self) -> None: ...

    def token_metrics(self) -> dict[str, float | None]:
        return self.tokens.as_metrics()


system = MyMemory()
system.tokens.record_call("query", input_tokens=120, output_tokens=30)
print(system.token_metrics()["tokens_per_query_mean"])
```

**Hold the collector as `self.tokens`, under that name**, even though the run never looks for it.
A tracked run at `workers > 1` builds one system per worker and pools the *collectors*, because a
statistic of rendered statistics is not a statistic of the population -- and it finds them by
that attribute (`memrank/evaluation/measurement.py`). A class that overrides `token_metrics`
while keeping no collector is refused there with that reason stated.

Declaring nothing is the common case: the result then reports `None` for each token bucket, which
says nobody counted rather than claiming the system spent zero.

**Internal timing** is the second, narrower declaration: `declared_latency()` -- or the
kind-neutral `declared_timings()` -- for time only your system can see inside the hop memrank
measured around it, a translator's `engine_ms`. Return SAMPLES per bucket, in milliseconds, never
percentiles: the run puts them on the [trace](reference/trace.md) as `engine_timings`, and a
tracked run pools them across the systems a `workers > 1` run builds and renders
`<bucket>_p50_ms` / `<bucket>_p95_ms` itself, so a run at any width reports the same statistic of
the same population. The conventional buckets are `ingest_engine` and `retrieve_engine`. A bucket
that would render one of memrank's own six measured keys is refused: a system does not report the
figure the reader reads.

A `memrank.instrumentation.LatencyCollector` is the shape those samples come from, and it is
yours: wrap your own calls with `collector.track("ingest_engine")`, then hand the samples back
from the declaration. A bucket you never sampled reports `None`, meaning "not reported".

## Transport and dependency neutrality

The `memrank.Memory` subclass *is* the neutral boundary. Neutrality does **not** mean "everything
over HTTP": some engines expose an HTTP API, others ship only as an in-process library or SDK,
and both are first-class.

- **memrank core depends on nothing vendor-specific.** It knows only the memory kind's four
  verbs.
- **The system owns its transport.** Wrap an HTTP API or a vendor SDK, whatever the engine
  provides.
- **Vendor SDKs are optional extras.** Where the class ships with memrank, declare them in
  `pyproject.toml` (`memrank[<engine>]`); either way, import them lazily inside the class and
  fail loud with an install hint when missing -- never make core import a vendor package.
- **Label the transport honestly.** Set `transport` to the real surface (`"http"` / `"sdk"` /
  `"in-process"`), per instance in `__init__` when your system supports more than one. Latency is
  comparable only within a transport class (see [methodology](methodology.md)), so a wrong label
  misleads readers.
- **Record the engine's internal config** -- the LLM or embedder it uses -- where you can, so
  what was actually compared is explicit rather than implied.

## Not core: registration, targets and the command line

**Memrank's interface is the Python package, and everything above is the whole of it.** The rest
of this document is the command line's own surface -- a catalog of named systems, kept working
but not developed -- and its older vocabulary: a **target** is its word for a named system, and
an **adapter** its word for the class that drives one. [The command line](misc/command-line.md)
is where that surface is documented.

Do the rest of this document when the system should be runnable **by name**: from the command
line, at `workers > 1`, in the cloud, or by other people. Registration decides where the code
lives and what may address it; it never changes what the four verbs do, and it never changes what
may be claimed about a measurement.

There are three ways to take that step.

| | **Register from outside** | **Write an in-tree adapter** | **Write a translator** |
|---|---|---|---|
| What you write | the same class, plus one `register_adapter` call | a Python `memrank.Memory` subclass, in this repo | a program serving [the translator contract](system-contract.md), in any language |
| Where it lives | your repository | `memrank/adapters/` | your repository |
| Needs a PR? | no | yes, plus entries in ~8 tables and 6 test lists | no |
| Works today on | `--on local`, sweeps and `workers > 1`, on a machine you configured; not the cloud, which carries only the manifests inside the package | every placement, including cloud | `--on local`, from a source checkout |
| Evidence class | derives from how the artifact was bound | artifact-backed, publishable | `development_observation`, `publishable: false` |
| Verify with | `memrank targets verify <ref>` | `pytest tests/live/conformance/test_adapter_contract.py` | `memrank targets verify <ref>` |

[`examples/more/custom-target/`](../examples/more/custom-target/README.md) wires a twenty-line
engine all three ways and runs offline.

Which one to pick:

- **In-tree** when an engine should appear on the public leaderboard. Publishable evidence
  requires a pinned, reproducible artifact, which a source-launched engine is not. Sections
  [3](#3-register-the-system-in-tree) to [6](#6-submit-a-pr) are that route.
- **A translator** when your engine is not Python, or when you would rather memrank never
  imported your code. Read [the translator contract](system-contract.md) and copy
  [`examples/more/native-adapter/`](../examples/more/native-adapter/README.md).
- **From outside** when you want the in-tree driving model -- your own Python `memrank.Memory`,
  your own target descriptors, the full `memrank submit` lifecycle -- without the class living
  here. [Registering a system from outside](#registering-a-system-from-outside) has the
  mechanics.

### 3. Register the system (in-tree)

Add the class to `memrank/adapters/__init__.py`, which is still the registry's file name:

<!-- runnable: no -- the registration line names `memrank.adapters.myengine`, the module you are about to write -->
```python
from memrank.adapters.myengine import MyAdapter
REGISTRY["myengine"] = MyAdapter
```

### 4. Make it a target (stack engines)

A registered class alone only supports `--adapter myengine` against a backend you stood up
yourself. For `memrank submit myengine ... --on local|cloud` to launch the engine, every
chokepoint below needs an entry -- each fails loudly, or is covered by an enumeration test, when
missing. `hindsight` is the worked example to mirror: its image is the vendor's own
(`ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight`, anonymous pull), so every file below is one you can read and
run without credentials.

| Chokepoint | File | What to add |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target manifest | `memrank/targets/builtin/myengine.yaml` | name/kind/adapter/transport, `engine: {artifact, port}`, declared `components`, `compose`, `service` |
| Compose graph | `memrank/targets/builtin/myengine.compose.yaml` | the engine's containers, image pinned by public reference |
| Presets (optional) | `memrank/targets/builtin/myengine-<preset>.yaml` | `from: myengine` + the component overrides (see `hindsight-matched.yaml`) |
| Engine env tables | `memrank/targets/engine_env.py` | one entry in each of `ENGINE_ENV`, `BASE_URL_ENV`, `ENGINE_SETTINGS`, `ENGINE_COMMAND`, `READINESS`, `PROVENANCE_FIELDS` (+ `PAIRED_TOKENS`/`SECRET_ENV` when applicable). Empty dict / `None` are positive statements; absence is an error. |
| Launch requirements | `memrank/secrets/requirements.py` | `REQUIREMENTS["myengine"]` with canonical providers; extend `PROVIDER_KEY_ENV` if the engine speaks its own provider vocabulary |
| Provenance | `memrank/provenance/engine.py` | `PROVENANCE["myengine"]` (purl identity, manufacturer/supplier, pedigree). `source_repo` is for a repository a reader of the receipt can actually fetch; a source that is not public sets `source_repo: None` plus `source_visibility: "private"` and a public `source_name`, and the commit is pinned by a locationless `pkg:generic/<name>@<commit>` purl instead of by a name nobody can resolve. |
| Enumerating tests | `tests/targets/test_catalog.py` (`EXPECTED`), `tests/live/conformance/test_adapter_contract.py` (`_backend_url`), `tests/placement/test_taskdef_render.py`, `tests/placement/test_local_placement.py`, `tests/provenance/test_engine_provenance.py`, `tests/secrets/test_requirements.py` | add the new name to each pinned list |

A component knob the engine exposes but the manifest leaves unstated fails the render
(`component_env`): declare every knob explicitly, even "the built-in default" -- an engine whose
deterministic fallback extractor is the default still has to say so, or the receipt cannot report
what ran.

#### Credentials: let the target say, don't extend the table

`REQUIREMENTS` derives an engine's credentials from its component *providers* -- right for a
vendor (`llm: {provider: anthropic}` means `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), and only that. It cannot express
a credential that is not one key per vendor. A target states its own instead:

```yaml
# names the engine reads directly
secrets: [LLM_API_KEY, EMBEDDING_API_KEY]

# a rename: what memrank resolves on the left, what the engine reads on the right
secrets:
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY

# anything at all -- memrank never interprets these
secrets: [MYENGINE_USER, MYENGINE_PASSWORD, MYENGINE_TENANT]
```

Each name is resolved through the one credential chokepoint -- process environment, then org
secrets, then the encrypted wallet -- and injected under the variable the target names. memrank
learns nothing about what any of them mean, which is the point: an engine authenticating with a
user and a password, a client id and a tenant, or a token under a name nobody anticipated needs
no change to memrank at all.

Declared secrets are **added to** what the providers imply, so a target can use both. Reach for
`PROVIDER_KEY_ENV` only when adding a genuine vendor that many engines will name.

#### Named native development target

Keep engine repositories independent of memrank. To evaluate an unpublished checkout *by name*,
place one complete, manually authored target in
`${MEMRANK_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.config/memrank}/targets/`:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
name: myengine:dev
kind: stack
interface:
  adapter: myengine
  transport: http
binding:
  kind: source
  root: /absolute/path/to/myengine
launch:
  command: "cargo run -p myengine-server -- --bind 127.0.0.1:{port}"
  requires: [Cargo.toml]
network:
  port: 8080
  readiness: {path: /health}
components:
  llm: {provider: regex}
```

The command is split into argv and executed directly; memrank adds no implicit shell. Use an
explicit `sh -lc '...'` only when shell behavior is genuinely required. `{port}` expands to the
target's declared `network.port`. The optional `requires` paths give an early wrong-checkout
error. The developer then runs:

```bash
memrank submit myengine:dev demo
```

Endpoint operations still belong in the named adapter. The target owns launch and readiness, and
the engine repository needs no memrank descriptor, Dockerfile or publishing workflow. There is no
target-creation command: author and review the central YAML directly.

This form requires an adapter that already knows the engine's wire protocol -- it is how a *fork*
of a known engine is evaluated. For an engine memrank has never seen, use `adapter: native` and
point `launch.command` at a translator instead; see [system-contract.md](system-contract.md)
section 9.

### 5. Run the conformance suite

```bash
pytest tests/live/conformance/test_adapter_contract.py -k myengine
```

Static checks -- class attributes, abstract method coverage, metric key shape -- run
unconditionally. Live smoke tests skip cleanly when your engine is not reachable.

The conformance suite is what a shared system is held to. For a system you only pass as an
instance, `memrank targets verify` and your own tests are the equivalent, and the most
consequential check either one runs is that state does not leak between groups of tasks.

#### Write tests beside the others

Anything you assert about *your* system's own behavior goes in `tests/adapters/`, one file per
system, named `test_<name>_adapter.py` alongside the ones already there. That directory is for
behavior that needs no live backend -- request shapes, partitioning, config resolution, what the
system does with a refusal. Anything that skips when your engine is not running belongs in
`tests/live/` instead, which is the one directory organized by what a test *needs* rather than
what it is about. [`tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md) states the rule for every directory.

### 6. Submit a PR

Per the vendor-neutral charter, AtomicStrata commits to reviewing valid PRs within 7 days.
Include the class under `memrank/adapters/<name>.py`, its registry entry, tests under
`tests/adapters/`, documentation for any new env vars, and a brief note on how to stand up the
backend locally.

### Registering a system from outside

Keep the Python `memrank.Memory` and the full lifecycle, but let the class live in your own
repository. `memrank/plugins.py` exposes `register_adapter`, which takes the adapter class **and
every table row that drives it** as one object:

<!-- runnable: no -- the registration names `MyAdapter`, the class you are writing, and `{...}` stands for your own provenance -->
```python
from memrank.plugins import AdapterRegistration, register_adapter
from memrank.secrets.requirements import EngineRequirements
from memrank.targets.engine_env import Readiness

register_adapter(AdapterRegistration(
    adapter=MyAdapter,
    engine_env={("llm", "provider"): "MYENGINE_EXTRACTOR"},
    base_url_env="MYENGINE_API_URL",
    readiness=Readiness("curl -fsS http://localhost:{port}{path} || exit 1", "/health", 60),
    engine_command=None,
    requirements=EngineRequirements("myengine", providers={"llm": "openai"}),
    provenance={...},
))
```

Point memrank at the module that makes that call, put it on the interpreter's import path, and
name a directory of your own for the engine's descriptors:

```bash
memrank config set adapters.plugins myengine_memrank
export PYTHONPATH=/abs/path/to/your/plugins
memrank config set targets.path /abs/path/to/your/targets
```

Both settings persist, and both are read on every command: a module named in `adapters.plugins`
that is not importable fails every command until the path is restored or the setting is cleared
(`memrank config set adapters.plugins ""`). That is the price of a name, and it is why the
instance route asks for neither.

An in-process system has nothing to launch and nothing to reach, so it uses
`AdapterRegistration.in_process(...)` instead, which asks only what launching it costs in
credentials and what the receipt should say about it.

The first seven fields of `AdapterRegistration` have no defaults on purpose. Each is read where
absence is either a loud failure far from its cause or -- for `provenance` -- a silent one:
without that row `build_provenance` returns `{}`, and the receipt loses not only the engine's
purl but the workspace pins (commit, dirty flag, working-tree delta) a source-bound target exists
to record.

**What this route does not confer.** A module found on `sys.path` has no version and no
resolvable origin, so registering through it earns no reproducibility claim of its own. The run's
evidence class still derives from how its *artifact* was bound, exactly as for a built-in --
which for a source-bound target means `development_observation`, `publishable: false`.
Registration decides where the code lives, never what may be claimed about the measurement.
