# AtomicMemory -- `atomicmemory`

```python
from memrank.systems import AtomicMemory

system = AtomicMemory(base_url="http://localhost:3070", api_key="...")
```

An HTTP client for AtomicStrata's AtomicMemory service.

## How it works

Memrank sends each document supplied by the [evaluation](../reference/evaluation.md) to the
service's memories endpoint, then retrieves memories relevant to each question. Each group
of [tasks](../reference/task.md) uses a separate namespace, which the client deletes during
cleanup to isolate independent groups.

The client also returns the engine's graph snapshot in the normalized format used by the
[relation-graph evaluation](../evaluations/relation-graph.md).

## Why it matters

AtomicStrata maintains Memrank and develops AtomicMemory. AtomicMemory is subject to the same
[measures](../reference/measure.md), context-budget rules and diagnostic controls as other
engines. Interpret its results using the recorded configuration and evidence rather than the
maintainer's relationship to the engine.

## What it needs

A running AtomicMemory service. Set its address with `base_url=` or `ATOMICMEMORY_API_URL`.
Where authentication is enabled, supply a key with `api_key=` or `ATOMICMEMORY_API_KEY`.

Cleanup deletes evaluation namespaces. Use a dedicated evaluation store, not data you need
to retain.
