# Supermemory -- `supermemory`

```python
from memrank.systems import Supermemory

system = Supermemory(base_url="http://localhost:6767")
```

An HTTP client for Supermemory AI's self-hosted memory server.

## How it works

The engine runs as a service. Memrank clears the namespace for a group of
[tasks](../reference/task.md), stores the supplied documents as memories, splitting long documents to meet the engine's
size limit, and searches that namespace for each question.

Supermemory's own design, as its authors describe it: memories are atomic and linked to each
other by exactly three relations -- one memory *updates* another, *extends* it, or is *derived*
from it -- and search combines meaning, keyword and graph. Memrank reads that graph in the
normalized shape the [relation-graph evaluation](../evaluations/relation-graph.md) needs.

## Why it matters

This client evaluates the self-hosted binary, whose memory engine is not open source. The
vendor's published scores use its hosted platform. Treat those as different configurations
when interpreting results.

## What it needs

A running Supermemory server. Its address comes from `base_url=` or `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL`,
defaulting to `http://localhost:6767`.

Preparing a group of tasks clears that namespace first. Never point it at a store whose contents
you want to keep.
