# LongMemEval -- `longmemeval`

<!-- runnable: no -- a one-time dataset download the first time it is constructed -->
```python
from memrank.evaluations import LongMemEval

evaluation = LongMemEval()
```

Five hundred questions, each one buried in its own separately built pile of chat sessions.

## How it works

Every question comes with its own haystack: dated user-and-assistant sessions, most of them
irrelevant, a few holding the answer. Memrank gives one question's haystack to the
[system](../reference/system.md) in the order the data lists it, one session at a time, and asks
the question only after all of them have gone in -- which is the task the authors define. Each
question is its own group, so its haystack is cleared before the next.

The dates travel inside the text of each session, because memrank cannot reorder what an engine
returns: an engine hands back its own documents, not memrank's, so ordering by timestamp would
only be possible for the controls and would make context order depend on which system was under
test. That divergence from the authors' own harness is declared rather than half-fixed.

## Why it matters

It isolates the thing memory is for. The same 500 questions ship at several haystack sizes, so
what changes between runs is how much irrelevant material the system had to hold -- not the
questions. The authors' headline is that assistants and long-context models lose about a third of
their accuracy when the questions move from a clean context into a large haystack.

**Quality here requires a judge.** The paper rejects string matching outright -- correct answers
take flexible forms -- and grades semantic and temporal consistency with a model instead. A span
proxy was tried here and withdrawn: it scored every question whose correct response is an
abstention at zero by construction, since an abstention has no answer text to find. Without a
judge this evaluation reports latency, failures and counts.

It is also one of two evaluations whose own protocol caps context at the model's window rather
than at a fairness budget, so memrank's token budget is lifted for it, symmetrically across every
system. Rows within it stay comparable; rows against other evaluations lose budget normalization.

## What it needs

A one-time download of the dataset, cached after the first run, or a local copy pointed at with
`LONGMEMEVAL_DATA_PATH`.

Quality also needs a judge, which means a model key and sending question text to that model.

The questions and code are MIT licensed; the haystack filler is drawn from other corpora whose
licenses are not. Caching it to evaluate is one thing, redistributing it another.
