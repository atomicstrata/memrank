"""Builtin targets a tree may not carry, and the one way a test says so.

`mem0` and `supermemory` name engine images no outsider can pull -- one is a private fork, the
other wraps a closed vendor binary we may not redistribute (`docs/engine-images.md`). The published
package therefore ships neither manifest, and a test written against one has nothing to resolve.

Such a test SKIPS, with the reason stated, exactly the way `tests/live/` skips when a backend is
not running: the condition is a probe of what is actually present, the assertions are untouched,
and the same test run against a tree that DOES carry the manifest still enforces every one of them.
What is not acceptable here is the alternative that was considered and rejected -- weakening an
assertion so it holds either way, which would retire the check in both trees at once.

Two calls, and the difference between them is when the answer is needed:

- :func:`require` inside a test body, for the usual case.
- :func:`skip_without` as a `pytest.mark.skipif` argument, for a module or a parametrised case
  whose ref is decided at collection time.

Neither takes a hardcoded list. The condition is "is this ref resolvable here", so a target that
later becomes publishable stops being skipped by the act of shipping its manifest, with no edit
here -- and a target that vanishes by accident is reported as skipped rather than passing silently,
which is why `tests/targets/test_catalog.py` still asserts the catalog's contents outright.
