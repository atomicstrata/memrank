"""memrank's deterministic scorer has a public name, and it is the demo benchmark's (ATO-2135).

The audit observed `ImportError: cannot import name 'score_query' from 'memrank.metrics'`: the
only scorer memrank ships lived in one benchmark's import namespace, so "my questions, memrank's
scorer" could not be written. These tests pin the three things that fixed it -- the name is
importable, the demo benchmark uses it, and a person who brings only questions gets a scored run.
