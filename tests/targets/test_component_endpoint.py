"""A component states WHERE its provider is reached, and the receipt records it.

Every provider but one carries its address implicitly: a vendor's API is where the vendor says it
is, `transformers` runs in-process, `regex` is the engine's own code. `openai-compatible` names a
protocol rather than a place, so its URL used to travel through the ambient environment -- and two
runs against different deployments produced byte-identical component records.
