"""Faithful variants declare a vendor's own depth, and that depth must reach the engine.

Matched mode holds every target to one budget; a faithful variant exists to answer a different
question -- "can we land near what the vendor published" -- and so must be able to state the
vendor's retrieval settings and run uncapped
(docs-internal/decisions/decision-matched-and-faithful-run-modes.md).

Two things were silently broken before these existed: a manifest could declare
``context_budget: uncapped`` and be capped anyway (the runner reads the attribute off the ADAPTER,
which only the in-process arms set), and there was no way at all to state an engine-specific
retrieval depth outside an adapter constant.

A faithful target used to be recognizable by its ``:suffix``. That inverted for mem0 on
2026-08-18 and for hindsight on 2026-08-19, and is now the general rule: a BARE ref names the
configuration its owner ships, so for a vendor's engine it is the vendor's and therefore faithful.
The mode lives in ``context_budget`` and nowhere else -- never in the ref.

Which makes the matched arms the fragile ones. ``hindsight:matched`` is comparable only because it
CLEARS the retrieval and ingest blocks it would otherwise inherit; several tests below exist to
fail if those lines are ever deleted as redundant.
