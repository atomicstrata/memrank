"""Every registered adapter must appear in every table keyed by adapter name.

Adding an engine means filling roughly eight name-keyed tables (docs/adding-adapters.md). Each one
raises loudly when its own entry is missing, but only at the moment it is read -- which for some is
a cloud render nobody runs locally, and for READINESS is a health check that never passes while the
harness waits for a task that will be killed.

Derived from REGISTRY rather than a hand-written list on purpose: a list would have to be edited by
the same person who just forgot the table. This is the enumeration test the chokepoint rule asks
for -- it fails when a new adapter lacks an entry, naming the table and the adapter.
