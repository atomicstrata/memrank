Three surfaces have to agree on these names: the engine process, the local compose renderer, and the
cloud taskdef renderer. Until now that agreement was a coincidence -- it held for mem0 because mem0's
server happens to use the names the adapter convention assumes, and it already failed for
atomicmemory and hindsight. These tests pin the names to the templates they were read from and make
an unnameable component a loud error rather than a silently dropped value.
