"""`memrank.system("word-overlap")`: a shipped system, by the name it is printed under.

The first line a person copies should not have to reach past the seven words into
`memrank.adapters`, and the name it uses should be the one they just saw listed -- so the
catalog names checked here are the registry's own, not a second list beside it.
