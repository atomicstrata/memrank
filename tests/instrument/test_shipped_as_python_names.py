"""`memrank.systems`, `memrank.evaluations`, `memrank.catalog()`: the catalog without a string.

`memrank.system("word-overlap")` presupposes the string. Nothing in an editor follows a string,
so a reader who has one cannot reach the class, and a reader who has none cannot find out what
exists. These hold the three things that fixes: the systems are the registered classes and not
copies of them, every shipped evaluation is an `Evaluation` subclass whose constructor builds
what the string form builds, and one call prints the whole catalog.

The downloading three are checked WITHOUT downloading: the class exists, its constructor is
typed, and a tier it does not have is refused before anything is fetched. A test that pulled
LoCoMo to prove `LoCoMo` is a class would be a test nobody runs offline.
