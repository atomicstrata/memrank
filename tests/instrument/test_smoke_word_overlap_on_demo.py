"""The shipped engine on the shipped evaluation, through the top-level run. No fakes.

The smoke run that found the defect this file now holds shut: every registered adapter returns
a `memrank.contract.Recall`, and a run loop still unpacking retrieve's old tuple turned all
five demo tasks into errors -- while the benchmark measure went on printing a number over
them, because a negative query with nothing retrieved scores as a hit. A run whose every task
failed must say so, not score it.

So this asserts the two halves together: zero errors, and a value per task that is not None.
