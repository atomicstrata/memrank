"""A result persists, and a measure thought of afterwards runs over the traces it stored.

This is the case decision 0009 moved scoring out of the run loop for (C23): a person who
thinks of a metric after the run must be able to get it from what was recorded, without
running the system again. So the test that matters is the equality: measuring afterwards, over
a result that has been through JSON, gives what measuring in the run gave.
