"""mem0 can keep a separate memory per speaker, the way its own published eval does.

memrank's matched mode gives every engine one partition per benchmark unit -- that shared scope is
what makes a cross-engine row mean anything. mem0's published LoCoMo runs did something else: a
memory per SPEAKER, searched separately, answering from roughly twice the memories one partition
returns (audit F13). Until now no target could express that, so the vendor target reproduced mem0's
models and not its scoping, and said so only in a comment.

These tests pin both paths against a fake transport: no mem0 server, no OpenAI key, no network.
The unpartitioned assertions are the regression gate -- matched mode must be untouched, because it
is the one that reaches the leaderboard. That gate matters MORE since 2026-08-18: the partitioned
path is what a bare `mem0` now does, and the unpartitioned one is reached only by `mem0:voyage` and
`mem0:bge-tei` clearing the inherited block.
