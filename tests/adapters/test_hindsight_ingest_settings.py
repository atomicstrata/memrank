"""Hindsight states its bank-creation settings, and proves the engine took them (audit F6, F7).

`enable_observations` decides which of hindsight's four memory networks are ever written, and it is
fixed when the bank is created -- no retrieval setting can reach it. AMB disables it to produce the
published numbers while the shipped product leaves it on, so the faithful `hindsight` was
reproducing a
configuration it did not have.

Two failure modes are asserted against, because both produce a NUMBER rather than an error:

  * the engine silently ignoring the setting (the bank PUT accepts unknown fields and echoes none
    of them back), and
  * retain being queued rather than settled, which recalls from a half-filled bank and scores as
    poor recall.

Request shapes here were observed against ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight, not assumed.
