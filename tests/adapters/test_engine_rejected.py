"""When an engine refuses, the message is the engine's, and it is not called a memrank bug.

Every HTTP adapter used a bare `raise_for_status()`, whose exception carries the status line and
the URL and not the body -- the only place an engine explains itself. On 2026-08-13 a BEAM run died
on `400 Bad Request for url .../v1/memories/ingest` with no reason recoverable anywhere, having
already completed three hours of ingest.

No adapter had a single test for its error path: every fake stubbed `raise_for_status` as a no-op,
so the branch was tested out of existence. This is that branch.
