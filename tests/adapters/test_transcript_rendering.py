"""One rendering of a Document, carrying WHEN the conversation happened.

Every text-ingesting adapter used to render documents its own way and none carried the
session date, so engines stamped 2023 conversations with ingestion time and 321 of 1540
LoCoMo temporal queries were unanswerable by construction (audit F15). Only hindsight has
a native ingest-timestamp field; the AtomicMemory wire contract has none, so the text is
the only channel every engine shares.
