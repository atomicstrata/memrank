"""Each engine retrieves in its own shape; memrank caps tokens, not result counts.

Two shapes were being misstated. Hindsight has no top-k -- it packs recall to a token
budget, and its vendor says so explicitly -- yet the adapter sliced results to ``k``, cutting
the engine off before the shared --token-budget could act. Supermemory inherited an API
default search mode its own vendor does not recommend, so a run measured a configuration
nobody chose (audit F4/F5, F9).
