"""A benchmark's protocol can declare the reader uncapped, and the runner honours it.

The 5000-token cap is memrank's leaderboard fairness control, but BEAM's protocol -- like every
published BEAM harness, including BEAM's own baselines -- hands the reader everything retrieval
returned. A capped run of it is not that benchmark
(docs-internal/decisions/decision-beam-runs-its-own-protocol.md), so `Benchmark.context_policy` exists
and `runner._effective_budget_mode` promotes matched arms accordingly. What must never happen:
the no-memory arm getting promoted (retrieving nothing is its point), or the promotion leaking
into benchmarks that did not ask for it.
