"""Unit test for the Mem0 HTTP adapter's search payload.

Pins the retrieve payload to what the Mem0 OSS server actually honors (verified
against a running server 2026-06-04): `top_k` (not `limit`) and `min_similarity=0`
so the server's default distance threshold doesn't filter out the top-k results.
