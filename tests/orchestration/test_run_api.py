"""``memrank.run`` -- the whole eval, in a script, with nothing saved.

The decoupling promise this package refactor exists for: get the adapter, run the
eval, get a typed result -- no run directory, no status file, no config, no terminal
output. What the CLI adds on top (registry, heartbeat, sync, cloud) is wiring, and a
library caller who asked for none of it gets none of it.

# `memrank.run` is now the typed run over the seven (memrank/instrument/); the cell run
