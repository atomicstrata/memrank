"""A benchmark can no longer overwrite a field of the result without being told.

``rollup()`` and ``config_for_receipt()`` are the two surfaces a benchmark names its own keys
on, and both are spread LAST into the artifact dict -- deliberately, and pinned there by
``test_golden_run.py``. That position is what let a benchmark naming one of its keys
``composite`` replace the measured value with its own: the artifact stayed well-formed, the
run reported success, and the number a reader ranked on was not the measurement.

The spread position is unchanged here. What changed is that a key which WOULD shadow a fixed
field is refused at assembly. This exercises it through a real ``memrank.run`` rather than by
constructing an ``EvalResult`` directly, because the claim is that a RUN fails -- a guard that
only fires when a test builds the object by hand would not have caught the case it exists for.

The last test is the enumeration: it walks the benchmark registry rather than checking the
five benchmarks that exist today, so a SIXTH whose keys collide fails here.
