"""The observable contract of a run, pinned before the runner split.

``runner.py`` is scheduled to be split into an eval library and a thin CLI (AGENTS.md).
These tests freeze what that split must not change: the artifact's exact key sequence, the
``status.json`` write sequence, which stream carries what, and the fact that a library call
touches nothing on disk. Each pins what IS, down to the byte where bytes are deterministic --
a failure here during the split means behavior drifted, not that this file needs loosening.

The sweep golden uses ``word-overlap,no-context x demo`` because it is the one full local
run that needs no engine, no credentials, and no network beyond the (cached) tokenizer --
the same shape ``test_local_sweep`` builds on.
