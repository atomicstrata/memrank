"""Every name runner re-exports from `memrank.evaluation` IS the moved object.

The eval loop left `runner.py` but its names did not: tests and in-repo consumers still
import (and monkeypatch) them through `memrank.runner`. A re-export that drifted into a
copy would let a patch on one module miss the code running in the other -- a silently
green test with a real subprocess behind it. Identity, not equality, is the property.
