"""The CLI's error boundary: one actionable line for mistakes, no stack for anything.

These drive ``runner.app`` and ``runner.main`` rather than ``CliRunner.invoke(app, ...)``,
because ``CliRunner`` calls the underlying click command and never enters
``Typer.__call__`` -- where the boundary lives.

Driving ``app()`` matters more than it looks. Console scripts are generated at install time,
so an editable install keeps whatever ``sys.exit(app())`` line it was created with no matter
how ``[project.scripts]`` changes. A boundary reachable only through ``main`` was, for every
already-installed CLI, no boundary at all; the first version of this file tested ``main``
alone and let exactly that ship.
