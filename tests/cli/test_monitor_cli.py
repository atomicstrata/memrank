"""`memrank logs` and `memrank status`, for a run wherever it ran.

This module had no tests at all, which is part of why a cloud run's output stayed unreachable
through the product for so long: nothing failed when `logs` answered "see the aws logs tail
command" instead of printing the log.

What these pin is the property the accounts design exists for -- a user reads their own run's
output without an AWS account -- and its converse, that no user-facing output mentions our
infrastructure.
