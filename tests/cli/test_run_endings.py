"""Every way ``memrank run`` ends reads as done, a step for the reader, or a memrank bug.

Driven through the real CLI boundary (``runner.main``), which is where an ending is rendered.
The table is the list of endings: each is arranged by making the run stop the way it would --
the loop's own exception, with the trace filled as far as that run got -- and each must show
its look, the commands to copy on lines of their own, the run's link wherever a run exists, and
no escape codes when the output is not a terminal. Only a failure inside memrank may say "bug
in memrank"; a provider, the network or the user's agent never does.
