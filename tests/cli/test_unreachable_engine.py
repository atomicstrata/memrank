"""`memrank submit mem0 locomo --on none` with no mem0 running is the user's fix, not a memrank bug.

It printed "internal error: ConnectError: [Errno 61] Connection refused / this is a bug in
memrank": the manifest cross-check asked mem0 for its configuration before anything else, and the
raw httpx error escaped to the CLI boundary. Driven through ``runner.main`` because the boundary
lives on ``_BoundedTyper.__call__`` (see tests/cli/test_cli_errors.py); only the socket layer is
replaced, so the refusal is deterministic and no port is opened.
