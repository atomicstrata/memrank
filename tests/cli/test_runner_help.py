"""Smoke tests for the CLI surface (no live backends).

The two assertions about the OPERATOR entrypoint -- that `memrank --help` leaks none of
`memrank.ops.OPS_COMMANDS`, and that every one of them still has a home on `memrank-ops` -- moved
to `tests/internal/test_runner_help_ops.py`. Both are about a public guarantee, but neither can be
stated without the internal command table, and `memrank.ops` is not in a public tree.
