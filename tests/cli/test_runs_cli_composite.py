"""One run must not read two ways.

`runs ls` renders a score from cells on disk, and this is the half of that guarantee a public
tree can state: the CLI projection, driven cell by cell.

The other two paths are the hosted API's -- it projects a score from the synced record, and when
this machine holds no artifact the listing shows the number the API sent.
`tests/internal/test_runs_cli_composite_api.py` drives the SAME table of cells through those,
importing the helpers below so the two halves cannot drift onto different fixtures. See
localdocs/plans/2026-08-25-repo-boundary-execution-plan.md, Phase 3.
