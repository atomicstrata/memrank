"""The client half of a browserless login: what it prints, and when it stops.

``sleep`` is injected and counted rather than waited on. A polling loop tested against a real
clock is the timing-dependent test this repo does not allow, and it would also take the
server's full ten-minute flow lifetime to assert the give-up case once.

The refusal tests matter as much as the happy path. A loop that treats every non-success as
"keep waiting" spins until the flow expires and then reports a timeout, hiding whatever the
server actually said -- which is precisely the failure the browserless flow exists to end.
