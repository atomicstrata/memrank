"""Every Python block in every public document, executed rather than trusted.

`tests/repo/test_doc_links.py` proves a document's links resolve and
`tests/repo/test_docs_teach_the_current_cli.py` proves its shell blocks name commands that still
exist. Neither runs a line of the Python a reader is invited to copy. Nothing did: the README's
blocks were executed by hand when it was written, and the 2026-09-16 and 2026-09-21 usability
sessions both produced the same failure -- a block copied from the front page that raised.

So each block runs here, in a fresh subprocess, against a temporary working directory, and a
non-zero exit fails. That is the whole contract, and there is exactly one way out of it.

**A declared marker.** A block that is not meant to execute says so in the document, on the
nearest non-blank line above its opening fence::

    <!-- runnable: no -- an interface sketch; the ABC is the subject, not a script -->

The comment is invisible in rendered markdown and the reason is free text, because the reasons
are not one kind. Two kinds are expected and both are declared the same way: a FRAGMENT, shown
inside a method body or naming a class the reader is about to write, which could never run; and a
LIVE DEPENDENCY -- a backend, a key, the network -- which could run somewhere but not here. The
second is the case `tests/withheld.py` already answers for an absent engine image, and this marker
is the same move for a document: the block SKIPS with its reason stated, rather than an assertion
being weakened until it holds either way.

There is deliberately no ratchet of tolerated failures beside it, the way `test_doc_links.py`
keeps one for dangling links. A link that dangles is inert; a block that raises is a degraded mode
this repository refuses, and pinning one would let a document go on inviting a reader to copy a
traceback. A block either runs or says why it does not, and a marker is a claim about what the
block IS -- so declaring one on a block that was written as a script and merely broke is a lie the
reviewer of that document is being asked to catch, not a mechanism this file offers.

**What is deliberately not here.** No block's stdout is compared to the `console` fence beside it.
That check is worth having and is a separate deliverable, and it cannot be built on top of this
one as written: `README.md`'s `print(result)` renders memrank's own measured latency, so its
output is legitimately different on every run. Nothing in this file asserts on a duration, and
nothing here is given a timeout -- a wall-clock bound is the timing-dependent logic this
repository refuses, and the blocks it covers are offline and finish in tenths of a second.

Shell blocks are not executed. They stay `test_docs_teach_the_current_cli.py`'s.
