"""The projection, checked.

`tests/repo/test_public_boundary.py` proves the manifest classifies every path. This proves the tool
that ACTS on it agrees -- that what `tools/project.py` writes is exactly what the classifier says is
public, that it refuses rather than emitting a wrong-looking tree, and that the `pyproject.toml`
rewrite drops what does not ship.

It also proves the projection is a function of a COMMIT and of nothing else, which is what lets one
projector serve both the local command and the export: an uncommitted edit, an untracked file at a
public path and a deleted file all leave the output unchanged.

Nothing here runs an install or a subprocess: the expensive end-to-end proof is a fresh virtualenv,
and it belongs in a human's hands or CI, not in the unit suite.
