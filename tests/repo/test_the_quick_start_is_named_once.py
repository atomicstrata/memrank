"""The quick-start pair is declared once, and every page and docstring that names it agrees.

0.4.4 made TFIDF on SQuAD the quick start. The README and install.md blocks moved; the prose on
the pages a reader reaches next did not. `docs/install.md` went on saying "where `WordOverlap()`
goes" through two commits that edited that very file with the documentation guards green, and
`reference/catalog.md` and `systems/word-overlap.md` went on giving the first result to the
demoted pair. The retired-name guard cannot see it by design: `WordOverlap` was DEMOTED, not
retired, and a demotion leaves the name valid everywhere.

What made it unguardable was that the pair was declared nowhere. It now is --
`memrank.instrument.catalog.QUICK_START` -- and this file holds three things to it:

1. the README's first Python block and install.md's quick-start block import exactly the pair;
2. the docstrings that teach a first import (`help(memrank)`, `memrank.systems`,
   `memrank.evaluations`, `Evaluation.run`) and examples/01 name exactly the pair;
3. no published sentence gives a first-result role -- "first result", "first number", "quick
   start", "smoke run", "where `X()` goes" -- to any other shipped class. On a page about one
   shipped class, a sentence naming no class is about that page's class ("It is also the system
   a first number is taken on").

The honest limit of (3): a phrase list misses a paraphrase. The declaration is what makes the
next demotion one edit, and this list is what finds the sentences the edit left behind.
