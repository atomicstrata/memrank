"""What a real import actually pulls in: the CLI's stack, and the library run path's.

Two boundaries, both checked in a subprocess against a real import rather than by reading
pyproject, because the question is what the module graph does.

`pip install memrank` gets the command; fastapi, uvicorn, psycopg and the Fernet backend live
in the `api` extra because only the service needs them. Nothing stops a future top-level import
from putting one back on the CLI's path -- at which point the extra still *resolves* (a developer
install has everything) and the breakage appears only in a user's `ModuleNotFoundError`.

So this is checked in a subprocess against a real import, not by reading pyproject: the question
is what the module graph actually pulls in.
