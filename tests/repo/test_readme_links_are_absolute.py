"""The README is read somewhere its relative links do not resolve.

`tests/repo/test_doc_links.py` asks whether a link names something this repository has. That is the
right question for every page but one. `README.md` is also the project description on PyPI, which
renders the markdown and resolves `docs/install.md` against `pypi.org` -- where no such page exists.
Every link on the 0.4.2 page was dead for that reason (ATO-2258), and a release's description is
immutable, so the fix can only ship with the next version.

So the README's links are absolute URLs into the public repository, and the other pages' stay
relative because they are only ever read on GitHub. Three things have to hold for that to keep
working, and each is one assertion below:

1. no link in the README is relative -- the defect itself, which is what a reader meets on PyPI;
2. a link into the public repository uses the `blob/main/` or `tree/main/` form, so it is a URL
   GitHub actually serves rather than a plausible-looking one;
3. the path it names is in the PROJECTION -- the published tree the URL resolves against. A path
   that exists here and is classified internal would be a live link to a 404, which no check
   confined to this repository can see.
