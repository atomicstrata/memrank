"""What published prose says ships is what the registries say ships.

0.4.4 added TFIDF, BM25 and SQuAD. `memrank.catalog()` reported eleven systems and six
evaluations the moment the code landed; five pages went on saying five evaluations, three module
lists left SQuAD or TFIDF out, and `reference/measure.md` said four measures ship where
`docs/measures.md` said five. Each was a snapshot of a count, and nothing held a snapshot to the
thing it counted.

Two claim shapes are read here, sentence by sentence:

- **a count of what ships** -- "ships five evaluations", "supplies eleven systems and six
  evaluations", "Five measures ship", "all six registered benchmarks" -- which must equal
  `len(memrank.systems.SHIPPED)`, `len(memrank.evaluations.SHIPPED)`, the measure classes
  `memrank/instrument/measures.py` defines, or `len(memrank.benchmarks.REGISTRY)`;
- **a membership list** -- "`memrank.systems` -- the module: `A`, `B`, ..." and "Evaluations
  ship for `a`, `b` ..." -- which must name exactly the shipped set.

A count of a SUBSET ("three shipped measures produce a quality value") is not one of these shapes
and is not read. A count phrased some third way is missed; that is this guard's honest limit.
