"""No message a user can see names a path they do not have.

`pip install memrank` installs the `memrank` package and nothing else: `scripts/`, `docs/`,
`tests/`, `examples/`, `tools/`, `deploy/` and everything else in this repository stay here. A
message that says "start the engines with `scripts/internal/backends.sh up`" therefore sends the
reader to a file that does not exist on their machine, at the moment they are already stuck --
which is what the 2026-09-16 sessions hit, and what ATO-2125 removed.

WHY ONE TEST AND NOT ONE PER SITE. The defect is a category. There were nine of these strings, in
six modules that have nothing to do with each other, and a test per site checks the nine that were
already found while saying nothing about the tenth. This enumerates instead: it walks every module
that ships, and a NEW reference fails here rather than in somebody's terminal.

WHAT COUNTS AS USER-VISIBLE. Every string literal except the docstrings -- error messages, `help=`
text, printed lines -- plus the docstrings of Typer commands, which `--help` prints verbatim. A
module or helper docstring is developer-facing and may say `docs-internal/...` freely; a command's
docstring is output.

WHAT COUNTS AS A BAD REFERENCE. A repository directory absent from an installed copy: every
`internal` prefix in `publish.toml`, plus the four public directories `pyproject.toml` excludes
from the wheel. Derived from the manifest rather than listed here, so the check follows the
boundary when it moves. A URL is exempt -- `https://github.com/atomicstrata/memrank/blob/main/docs`
contains `docs/` and is the correct thing to print, because the reader can open it from anywhere;
`memrank.docs.doc_url` builds those.
