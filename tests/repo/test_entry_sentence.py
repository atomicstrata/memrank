"""The three first surfaces say the same thing about what memrank is.

There are three surfaces a person meets first and no two of them met the same way: `README.md`
called memrank *"an instrument for measuring AI memory engines"*, the package docstring said the
same in different words, and `memrank --help` called it a *"benchmark suite"* -- a different
word for the thing, on the surface with the least room to explain itself. Two recorded feedback
sessions in September 2026 failed at exactly this point: a person who had read the entry page
could not say what memrank measures.

Three surfaces drift because nothing compares them. This compares them: each must carry the
one-line definition, and each must use the one word for what memrank is. The word is asserted in
both directions -- present, and the retired one absent -- because a surface that gains the
sentence and keeps calling memrank a benchmark suite has half-landed and reads as landed.

`pyproject.toml` is the fourth surface, and it is what PyPI renders, so it carries the sentence
and the word too. `docs/SPEC.md`'s "One line" is the fifth: the specification calls itself the
document to cite in a dispute about method, so the line a citer quotes says the same thing.

The sentence pinned here is the maintainer's own, recorded in direction decision 0011 and landed
by ATO-2249: *"Memrank is a tool for reproducible, auditable evaluation of memory systems."* It
replaced a longer predicate about what is measured, and with it went a second assertion that the
entry surface also named which pieces were the reader's. That half now belongs to the quick start,
where a reader meets it while running something rather than before they have run anything.
