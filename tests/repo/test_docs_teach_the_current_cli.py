"""No live doc or script may teach a command the CLI refuses.

The cutover to the interface model was done in three passes and each one missed what the last
had already touched: `019d19e` repointed "every surviving script hint" at `memrank run --on
cloud`, `3ee60ce` renamed `run` to `submit` without revisiting those hints, and the `--slice`
retirement revisited neither. Sixteen call sites were still printing refused commands months
later, including the six `build-push*.sh` scripts that echo one to the terminal on success --
copy, paste, exit 2.

Per-file vigilance is what produced that, so the control is enumerated instead: this walks the
live corpus against :mod:`memrank.cli.retired`'s own tables, and a flag cannot be retired
without every instruction that teaches it failing here. The historical corpus is excluded by an
explicit list rather than by a pattern, so bringing a new directory under the rule -- or
declaring one a record of what was typed at the time -- is a deliberate edit to this file.

#: lives in notebooks/README.md, which IS scanned.

#: dated audit or a repro's narration would falsify the record it exists to preserve -- the point
#: of a 2026-08-12 evidence file is that this is the line that produced that number.
#:
#: `docs/SPEC.md` was here as "a frozen copy of the 2026-05-09 public spec" and is not exempt any
#: more. It is the specification a public reader is pointed at, and a specification that may
#: teach `memrank run --adapter X --benchmark Y` is a specification of a CLI that does not exist.

DATED_AUDIT = re.compile(r"/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-")

#: `docs/repro/` carries the same date prefix and is deliberately NOT exempt. A repro doc's whole

#: not a record, so it is the one dated corpus that has to keep working.

#: `--tier` and `--ack-egress` (memrank/ops/analysis_cli.py) and is a DIFFERENT product -- the
#: platform team curating a leaderboard, not a user evaluating a memory system. Keying on the
#: invoked command rather than the bare flag string is what keeps this test off its back.

#: Retired *command names* are only wrong when someone is told to type them. `memrank run` in
#: prose about the past is not an instruction, but inside a shell block it is one, so the same
#: INVOCATION anchor decides both.
