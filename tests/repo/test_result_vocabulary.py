"""A result's identity keys are named in one module, and this enumerates every other one.

``adapter`` and ``benchmark`` are the stored artifact's two identity keys. Nine modules read
them by literal subscript -- the arena curator, the compare renderer, the leaderboard
normalizer, the run registry, the sweep's summary row, the ops report, the version diff, the
question drilldown and the API projection -- so the artifact vocabulary was interpreted in
nine places and renaming it was nine edits with no list of which nine. Two of those modules
translated the pair into the outward ``target``/``eval`` vocabulary independently, which is
two places a rename had to find and one of them undocumented.

So this is an ENUMERATION rather than a set of fixes: it walks every module under
``memrank/`` and fails when one names either key, which is what makes a NEW surface reaching
for the raw key fail here rather than silently becoming the tenth. Reads go through
:mod:`memrank.evaluation.result`'s four accessors, and the one translation into the outward
vocabulary is :func:`memrank.api.run_projection.identity_of`.

**The allowlist below is not a list of exemptions.** Every entry is a dict that is NOT a
result: a run heartbeat, an org API payload, a compare artifact's own metadata, a leaderboard
board, a target manifest. Those carry a key spelled the same and mean something else, and a
static scan cannot tell them apart -- so each is named with the expression it reads, which is
what makes the claim checkable by someone reading this file.
