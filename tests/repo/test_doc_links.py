"""Markdown links, checked rather than trusted.

`tests/repo/test_public_boundary.py` proves the CODE boundary holds: no public module imports an
internal one. This is the same question asked of prose, and it has the same two failure modes.

1. A link that resolves to nothing. Documentation that points at a file which moved is worse than
   documentation that says nothing -- it costs a reader the trip.
2. **A PUBLIC document linking an INTERNAL one.** That link resolves perfectly here and is dead in
   the published tree, because the file it names is never copied there. Nothing in this repository
   can notice on its own: the target is right there on disk.

Both are pinned rather than merely counted. The two sets below are ratchets, asserted in BOTH
directions -- a new offender fails, and so does an entry that has been fixed and not removed. That
is what stops a list of known problems from quietly becoming a list of tolerated ones.
