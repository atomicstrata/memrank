"""The seven are the Python surface, and the names they replaced cannot creep back.

`tests/repo/test_docs_teach_the_current_cli.py` records why this is enumerated rather than
left to per-file vigilance: the CLI's cutover was done in three passes, each one missed what
the last had touched, and sixteen call sites were still printing refused commands months
later. This is the same control for the Python surface, and it has the same two halves.

**The surface.** `memrank.__all__` is pinned to the seven, the kinds a person subclasses, the
measures memrank ships and the two readings above the run -- so a name cannot join the first
thing a person reads without a deliberate edit here -- and `memrank.run`'s parameters are
checked by position: the first two are `system` and `evaluation`. The previous run keeps its
own contract, checked here too: it is `memrank.evaluation.api.run`, its first two parameters
are `engine` and `evaluation`, and every deprecated spelling is keyword-only and named in
:data:`memrank.evaluation.api.DEPRECATED_PARAMETERS`. A third spelling fails here.

**The corpus.** Every live document, example and script is scanned for the spellings this
step retired. A retired spelling in an instruction is a person typing it tomorrow.

*Retired* here is about what a document may teach, not about what still imports. The nine
shipped system classes dropped their `Adapter` suffix (ATO-2220) and the old spellings are
kept as aliases for code outside this repository; :data:`SUFFIXED_ALIASES` names all nine,
which both feeds the corpus scan and asserts each one still resolves to the same class object.
So a document that teaches `WordOverlapAdapter` fails, and a checkout that has quietly deleted
it fails too -- the second is what tells a retired spelling apart from a removed name.

**The operator layer.** A third table names what is importable from `memrank` and deliberately
off `__all__`, and asserts the entry path never makes a reader meet it. `Benchmark` is the case
that table exists for (ATO-2210): it could not be renamed to `Evaluation` -- a different class
holds that name -- so it was demoted instead, and demotion, unlike a rename, leaves nothing
behind that fails when it is undone. `memrank.evaluation(ref)` is the route to a named
evaluation; `Benchmark` is what that route resolves one to.

**What is deliberately not here.** `MemoryAdapter`, `MemoryEngine` and `EvalResult` are
*deprecated*, not retired: they still work, they may still be named in a document that is
explaining the deprecation, and ATO-2151 is what removes them and extends the table below.
`Benchmark` is neither -- it is demoted and it stays. And `memrank submit TARGET EVAL` keeps
its own nouns -- *target* is the command line's word for a catalog entry, this step did not
change it, and `examples/more/custom-target/` is about exactly that. Only Python spellings are
scanned, never a file name.
