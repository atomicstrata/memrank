"""The public/private boundary, checked rather than described.

`publish.toml` says which paths ship. Until this file existed, that was a claim in a document,
and the failure mode of a claim in a document is specific and known: someone adds an internal
module, nobody classifies it, and the mistake surfaces as a leak in a public repository rather
than as a red test here.

So there are three assertions, and they correspond to the three ways the boundary can be wrong:

1. a tracked path matches no rule, or matches two that disagree -- the manifest has gone stale
   against the tree;
2. a public module imports an internal one -- the projection would not import;
3. the closure of the published entry points reaches outside the public set -- the projection
   would not run.

There is a fourth, and it is the one none of those three can see: material that is not tracked at
all. `git ls-files` does not list it, so every assertion above steps over it, and the projector
reads committed objects -- which makes the exposure window exactly one moment wide, the commit that
first tracks the file. `test_no_untracked_path_would_be_published` closes that window by asking for
the decision one step earlier, while the material is still undecided.

The manifest is deliberately a PREFIX list with an exceptions table, and the exceptions table is
deliberately written out in full. See `publish.toml` and
`docs-internal/plans/2026-08-25-repo-boundary-execution-plan.md`.

    and `docs/research/` sat untracked under a now-public prefix, and would have classified PUBLIC
    the instant anyone staged them. Nothing would have objected -- a prefix rule matches a whole
    directory, so internal material lands inside a public tree by inheriting a classification that
    was never made about it.

    So the guard is deliberately about the DECISION, not about the content: no rule can tell an
    internal pitch deck from a public methodology note once both sit under `docs/`. What it can
    tell is that nobody has said which this is. Three answers satisfy it, and each records the
    decision somewhere durable:

    * it ships -- stage it, and the change is then visible in a diff someone reviews;
    * it never ships -- add it to `[exceptions] internal` in `publish.toml`, or move it under an
      internal prefix (`docs-internal/`, `tests/internal/`, `scripts/internal/`);
    * it is not repository material at all -- add it to `.gitignore`.

    `test_every_tracked_path_is_classified_exactly_once`, which catches it the moment it is
