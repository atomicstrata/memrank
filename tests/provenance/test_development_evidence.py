"""Workspace observations may sync privately but never enter a public leaderboard.

The receipt is where that starts: it declares the evidence class, and the default must be the
publishable one. What the LEADERBOARD then does with a non-publishable receipt -- refuse to
normalize it, and say why -- is asserted in `tests/internal/leaderboard/test_development_evidence.py`,
because `memrank.leaderboard` is not in a public tree. See
docs-internal/plans/2026-08-25-repo-boundary-execution-plan.md, Phase 3.
