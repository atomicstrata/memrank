"""Turning PEP 610 back into an instruction the reader can actually type.

An upgrade instruction is only as good as its fit: handing a released install a
``git+https://...`` command replaces that release with a branch checkout, and handing a uv
tool environment a ``pip install`` upgrades a copy the ``memrank`` on PATH does not run. Both
are ways of answering a question nobody asked, so the shape of the install is asserted here
rather than assumed.

The metadata is faked, not the reader -- each test hands the real code the
``direct_url.json`` pip or uv would have written, and the real installed location.
