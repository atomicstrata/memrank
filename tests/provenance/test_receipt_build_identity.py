"""Which build a receipt says produced the run (ATO-1855).

``memrank_version`` used to be the package version plus ``git rev-parse HEAD`` run in the
CALLER's working directory. Inside this repository that answer is right by accident; from a
wheel install inside a user's own project it records their commit as memrank's provenance --
a plausible wrong identifier in the artifact whose whole purpose is reproducibility.

The install a receipt is built from is faked here (the exact ``direct_url.json`` pip and uv
write, per PEP 610), while the repositories are real ``git init``s, because the defect was
precisely that a real, unrelated repository answered a question about memrank.
