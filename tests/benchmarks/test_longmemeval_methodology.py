"""LongMemEval methodology pins -- the Tier-A assertions from protocol-fidelity section 5.1.

The FIRST loader-level tests this benchmark has ever had. `test_longmemeval_scoring.py`
hand-builds BenchmarkUnits and never calls `load()`, which is precisely how two defects survived
unnoticed: the evidence set built from `has_answer` rather than `answer_session_ids` (a strict
subset on 62 of 500 questions), and slices that take `raw[:N]` from a type-GROUPED file and so
cover one of six question types.

Pinned here: the six-type fingerprint, abstention as an id suffix rather than a seventh type,
the dataset digest, and slice stratification.
