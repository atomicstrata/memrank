"""LongMemEval ships its ground truth inside its session ids. We must not pass them on.

Every evidence session id in `longmemeval_s_cleaned.json` begins with the literal prefix
`answer`, and the official retrieval scorer keys on exactly that
(src/retrieval/run_retrieval.py:272, `[d for d in corpus_ids if "answer" in d]`). The prefix is
a NOISE-FREE oracle: the count of `answer`-prefixed sessions equals the gold count at every
cardinality, so ranking on it alone scores recall_all@5 = 0.994 and recall_all@10 = 1.000 --
above the paper's best published retriever (0.862).

memrank forwarded those ids to every engine twice: as `Document.id`, which every adapter passes
through as metadata (docs/adapter-contract.md:71 makes it contractual), and again inside
`Document.context`, which supermemory maps to `entity_context` and hindsight to `item["context"]`
-- semantically indexed fields.

That made it a VALIDITY defect rather than a comparability one, and an engine-dependent one:
how much a given engine benefited turned on whether it indexed ids, so it corrupted the ORDERING
between engines, not merely the level. These tests are the guard.
