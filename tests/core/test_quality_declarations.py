"""The caveat prose survives being split into parts a result can carry.

`core.QUALITY_METRIC_LABELS` and `QUALITY_METRIC_DESCRIPTIONS` are now derived from
`memrank.quality.QUALITY_METRICS`. Every terminal surface still reads those two dicts, so
their values are pinned here against the literals they replaced -- character for character.
A reworded caveat is a deliberate act and should fail this test.
