"""Either half of an evaluation may be the person's, and never the half they did not bring.

The three runs step 8 exists for, written the way a person would write them, plus the seam that
keeps them safe: both halves declare what they produce and expect, and a disagreement is refused
before any item runs rather than averaged.
