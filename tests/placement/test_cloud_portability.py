"""A cloud task can only resolve the targets shipped with memrank.

`targets.path` and the operator's own directory exist on ONE machine. A ref that resolves here can
be unresolvable in a cloud task, and it costs a Fargate task to find out: on 2026-08-13
`mem0:memory-arena` -- defined in a sibling repo on the submitter's laptop -- launched and its
container exited 1 on its first line with `unknown target 'mem0:memory-arena'`. Nothing was
misconfigured, and no newer harness image would have helped.

The property under test is that the refusal happens BEFORE anything is submitted, at every door.
