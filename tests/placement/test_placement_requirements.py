"""A placement reports what it needs, and the run refuses before it is minted.

The failure this closes: with no Docker on PATH, `submit --on local` printed
``error: internal error: FileNotFoundError: ... 'docker'`` followed by "this is a bug in memrank" --
memrank blaming itself for the user's machine -- and it printed it *after* minting a run, so what
the user was left with was a run record marked failed rather than a refusal.

There is deliberately no `doctor` command wrapping these rows (localdocs/interface-model.md section 6). The
rows come from the placement that needs them and are what `provision` enforces on, so the refusal
a user reads and the failure that would have happened cannot drift apart -- the SkyPilot
`sky check` failure mode recorded in localdocs/decisions/decision-placement-owns-its-requirements.md.
