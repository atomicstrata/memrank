"""Compiling a Compose graph into ECS containers, and refusing what it cannot compile.

Every rule here maps something with a published meaning on both sides, so these tests are readable
as "does the translation say what Compose says". The refusals matter more than the translations:
each one exists because ECS cannot express a Compose feature faithfully, and a compiler that
quietly drops what it does not understand produces a task definition that launches and measures
something other than what was declared.

None of these paths had ever executed. They were added with the compiler and left untested, and
writing these tests found three defects -- a valid `depends_on` form that crashed, a missing image
that raised `KeyError`, and a host rewrite that replaced service names inside unrelated values.
