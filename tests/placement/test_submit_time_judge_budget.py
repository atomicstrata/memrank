"""A judged cloud submission settles what it can settle here, not inside the Fargate task.

On 2026-08-13 four tasks died on the same arithmetic -- `beam:100k-smoke` needs 288 judge calls and
the default cap was 200 -- each after an image pull and a 274 MB dataset download. The check itself
was correct and had been there for months; it ran on the wrong side of the wire, because `--on
cloud` returned from the command before `_sweep_gates`.

The cap that produced those failures is gone: a ceiling on the JUDGE bounds the measurement rather
than the system under test, since which queries got graded would depend on where a counter ran out.
What survives is the arithmetic, reported, and the coverage refusal -- a judged run that can score
nothing still costs a task to discover.
