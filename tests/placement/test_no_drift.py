"""The gate: local and cloud may not describe different systems under one target name.

This is the spec's headline defect, expressed as a test. `deploy/ecs/taskdef.mem0.json.tpl` welded
`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` / `384` into the file, so asking for `mem0:voyage` in the cloud ran
bge-small while the leaderboard row still said voyage. Both renderers now derive components from
`memrank.targets.engine_env`, and these tests prove it for EVERY target rather than for the one
someone remembered to check.

Enumerated from the catalog, per the `CLAUDE.md` chokepoint rule: a new target is covered the moment
it is added, and fails here until it renders on both sides. A literal list would silently pass.
