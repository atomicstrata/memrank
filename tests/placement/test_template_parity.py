"""Nothing the retired ECS templates configured may vanish from the rendered task definition.

M6 replaced four hand-authored `deploy/ecs/taskdef.*.json.tpl` with a renderer. Four separate facts
were lost in that move -- the TEI mirror, per-engine image tags, per-engine health checks, and a
shared bearer token -- and every one was found by a question or a paid failure rather than a test.
Only the last announced itself; the rest were silent.

So this compares names, engine by engine, against the frozen originals in
`tests/fixtures/retired_taskdefs/`. **Values are deliberately not compared** -- most are derived now,
which is the entire point of M6. A variable *disappearing* is the defect this catches.

It is necessary, not sufficient: a variable set to a wrong value still passes here. Component values
are the drift gate's business (test_no_drift.py); nothing yet covers the rest.
