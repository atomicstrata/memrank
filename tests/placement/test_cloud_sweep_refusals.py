"""A refused target must not cost the rest of a cloud sweep its submission.

The regression is real: an 8-target locomo sweep (2026-08-03) submitted two runs, hit a
transient Fargate capacity shortfall on the third, and abandoned the remaining five -- none of
which had anything to do with the refusal. Runs are independent, so they are submitted
independently and the refusals are named together at the end.
