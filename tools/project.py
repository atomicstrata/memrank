"""Produce the public tree from `publish.toml`. The one projector.

    python -m tools.project --out /tmp/memrank-public [--rev HEAD] [--dry-run]

WHAT "THE ONE PROJECTOR" MEANS. Every consumer that needs a public tree runs THIS -- the local
command a person types, and the ops sync that opens the export pull request. A projection that
two programs can produce is a projection that can differ, and the difference is invisible precisely
where it matters: the tree that gets pushed. The export orchestration calls
`python -m tools.project --root <clone> --rev <sha> --out <snapshot>` and pushes what lands there;
it does not build a tree of its own. That command IS the contract, and `--rev` is the whole of it.

WHY A COPY AND NOT `git archive | delete`. Both produce the same tree when nothing goes wrong, and
they fail in opposite directions when something does. Archive-then-delete starts with everything
and removes 1160 paths: a rule that fails to match leaves an internal file in the output, and the
output looks fine. Copy-from-the-public-set starts with nothing and adds 429: a rule that fails to
match leaves a public file OUT, and the tree fails to import. One failure mode is a leak nobody
sees, the other is a red build. This module takes the second.

WHY COMMITTED OBJECTS AND NOT THE WORKING TREE. The projection is a function of a commit, and only
of a commit. Reading blobs at a tree-ish means the same revision projects to the same bytes from
any machine in any state: an uncommitted edit cannot reach the output, an untracked file sitting at
a public path cannot reach it, and a stale file left over from a deleted branch cannot reach it.
Copying from disk made all three possible, and none of them are visible in the result.

The classification rule itself is not reimplemented here -- see `tools/manifest.py`.
